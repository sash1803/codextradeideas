all right we should be live welcome back people just give me a quick confirmation
0:16
on the screen in the chat that you can hear my voice okay and that you can see
0:22
my screen just waiting for the confirmation
0:29
once I get the confirmation will kick off all good excellent all right so as
0:34
always welcome back I finally recovered after a a slight hindrance of a cold
0:41
let's say but um as always thank you for tuning in once again it's uh an exciting
0:47
time in the market No Doubt with Bitcoin making new alltime highs and before we proceed a special
0:54
thank you to Prime xbt for sponsoring this stream as always I've been partnered with them for the best of four
1:00
years now it was around about November 2020 when I first started streaming so
1:06
uh it's quite um amazing how time flies and also a special shout out to uh
1:13
Destro Network for also uh partnering with me uh big shout out to the team really looking forward to working with
1:19
them over the coming weeks and months okay as always anything said in today's stream is not Financial advice it is
1:26
just my view of the market and we'll keep kick off before we kick off let's start off on the high
1:33
time frame chart so um thoughts so far let me just ask the chat first of all
1:40
price targets for Bitcoin where do we think the top is likely to be any guesses anybody are we going to top out
1:48
at 100K 110 120 or are we going to go to maybe higher so be interesting just to
1:55
see what the sentiment is in the chat
2:02
no idea it's all a bit of fun isn't it really it's just just some guesstimate numbers as to where we potentially think
2:10
a the high of Bitcoin could be for this cycle but uh nice 165 I think is
2:20
300K nice I mean that' be great but um yeah okay so some people think round
2:28
about 120 130 140 150 if you asked me I honestly couldn't
2:33
tell you and I think there's a reason why I asked that question because nobody really knows in all honesty where
2:40
Bitcoin is going to go next and all we can do as Traders is just Mak inform
2:45
form decisions based upon the chart right so I think this move has caught
2:50
many by surprise uh it doesn't come as any surprise to me if if you've watched
2:56
my streams since September we've maintained able stance in the market uh
3:02
I've covered in numerous streams uh throughout the last several months that when you see and this is a monthly time
3:08
frame when you see Wicks being Illustrated on the chart such as
3:13
this clearly shows buyers stepping into the market um and like I said there was a level of concern by you know voiced by
3:21
many on the timeline that this is bearish Market structure because we're making higher highs and sorry lower lows
3:27
and lower Highs but it's still within the context of a range okay price never really broke down into a trend and we
3:33
never saw that continuation so looking at this chart immediately the first
3:39
question is why in your right mind would you be looking to fade anything that's a
3:45
significant break above this key mid-range here okay we've had one two
3:51
three four five six attempts to break this
3:56
mid-range and all people are concerned about all of a sudden is that we've finally broken the range it's time to be
4:01
cautious I'm not sure that's the right approach secondly I don't think trying to short the first impulsive break out
4:08
of a range unless it's other than a hedge against your position then fine but ultimately I think it's very very
4:15
difficult to short this type of momentum in the market it's not worth taking on the risk and blowing out
4:21
unless you have very high conviction that you are likely to trade what is
4:26
likely to be a local top the third part is this shouldn't come as a surprise because if you look
4:32
at measured moves in terms of range quarters I covered how I've come to this range projection whether you want to use
4:38
fit projections whether you want to use range projections ultimately you have to find or devise a system which works for
4:45
you and for me I've developed uh this thanks with the input of the likes of
4:51
Trader SC who who first showed me this and how he uses it and I've kind of adopted my own slight take or variation
4:57
of this and all this basic clear is I think there's some confusion is that
5:02
people assume that this is some sort of like guesstimation where price goes
5:09
ultimately how I look at your ranges and how I use them is to manage risk I'm not
5:14
in this game or industry like how once was trying to pull price predictions out of my ass and say Bitcoin is going to go
5:20
to 200,000k it's great for the timeline it's great for the clout chasing aspects
5:25
but the reality is the way that I use technical analysis and price action is
5:30
purely from a risk management perspective where can I have an invalidation point where can I have an
5:36
entry or a trigger point and where am I looking for price to trade next okay
5:41
they're the three aspects that I look at then I think about taking the position size then I think about taking the
5:46
actual trade on once I get my trade execution so looking at this chart I I I
5:53
you know I'm it's been quite impressive with this rally um and again I don't have any concerns you know we May at
6:00
some point get a snap back in price okay it shouldn't come as a surprise where if
6:06
over the next week or so this might just be a local top okay and we get a snap
6:11
back into this round about 81 82k level okay if you look at previous rallies
6:17
historically if you go back in time and just look at the chart I remember this in in January 2021 into February we had
6:26
Bitcoin break out of the previous all-time highs it was at $20,000 right
6:31
where did price go next if you look at the range extension literally to the midpoint okay over one 2 3 4 days of
6:39
extension price had traded from 20,000 up into 41
6:44
42,000 and then over a matter sorry this was over weeks 1 2 3 4 5 six weeks then
6:51
over a matter of weeks we got that aggressive pull back into that mid mid-range mid level okay one 2 3 weeks
6:58
consolidation continuation higher so the first thing that I would be
7:05
looking to identify from a trading perspective is one unless I have some
7:10
relatively large exposure to bitcoin or I feel uncomfortable and I think there's a chance that Bitcoin could pull back
7:17
then in that instance I may consider taking a hedge which I tried to do early in the week I tried to short 94,000
7:23
price traded into low 93s I saw that price failed to break down for further
7:29
lower and one aspect that you have to think about in trading is how much time
7:35
is it taking for price to push away from a level and secondly are you trading against a trend in this instance I was
7:42
trading against the trend and in the second instance that the second point that I made it was taking significant
7:47
amount of time for Bitcoin to trade back into the 85 86 level that was enough of a reason for me to cut the trade
7:53
straight away uh literally no loss or no gain okay so sometimes you have to assess the situation that you're in
8:00
now the the point I'm trying to make is if you look at Bitcoin here uh previously in uh 20221 January into
8:08
February I believe the correction was around about 20 30% correct me if I'm
8:13
wrong but there we go literally 30% correction from 42,000 straight down to
8:21
29,000 and many people were calling this that bitcoin's high as in It's Over The
8:28
Honest reality is we don't know when we just have to wait for signs of distribution or signs for exhaustion at
8:33
the highs now taking into consider consideration again where Bitcoin is in
8:39
this instance right we've traded a significant move okay if you've been following my streams and looking at
8:47
where I've been positioned into Bitcoin we've been taking advantage of the Longs on each of these lows my actual spot
8:52
position is an average of 53 I think 53.8 call it 54k okay Above This Zone
9:00
was where my spot entry is and I've trade well left my spot position all the
9:06
way high whilst I've been trading within the range so you can effectively run two positions at the same time one is a spot
9:12
position and one is a leverage position okay or a Futures position now what I'm looking at the chart here um again using
9:19
these range projections because we are in a level of price Discovery we are in a trending environment so in this
9:25
instance it's easy to get caught up trying to search for a top look for a top trying to time the top because you
9:32
think there's there's going to be a significant move down but the the har reality is timing these local tops in a
9:39
trending Market you're literally pissing Against the Wind and that's it you just don't know when there's likely to be a
9:45
reversal Point um but and the chances are you're going to get stopped out very quick so if you are taking on those risk
9:50
scenarios or you're looking to hedge out there's a good chance you could get stopped out you've got to be prepared
9:56
for that and you've got to be prepared for the fact that you could get pushed out position
10:01
but let's just take for example what a 20% correction would look like in this instance if we deem a top to be a local
10:09
top to be in about 100 102 before we see a move back down so trading back into the 81 8 82k level is just a 20%
10:16
correction that's fairly normal fairly reasonable by Bitcoin standards if you look at Corrections
10:23
back here uh we had a 20% correction from 53 down to uh 40K you know in
10:30
previous markets so again I I wouldn't be overly concerned if there is a corrective move down I think that's
10:36
opportunity to perhaps I'm not sure about from a spot perspective but how I'd be thinking about it is maybe from a
10:42
trading perspective okay if you're looking for uh long-term advice on this
10:47
stream I'm not here to give you Financial advice it's it's more from a trading perspective but but for now I
10:53
think you you you have to maintain and go with a go with a momentum and when you do get these um Sharp pull backs
10:59
into price then try to identify where price is likely to pull back into the
11:05
second scenario is what if we don't get a pullback what if price continues
11:12
higher how how would you then look to get on board so if I'm looking for continuation
11:17
higher in this instance what you often find is that the consolidation ranges
11:24
are very very narrow and this is the scenario where you don't get a deep pullback so what does that mean you see
11:29
price break out of a range or a trend into a trend and you get these narrow
11:35
consolidations for two three days and then continuation higher and again if you look at Bitcoin here when it broke
11:40
out of this range from December all the way through to February a good three
11:46
months January uh December January mid-February two and a half months okay
11:51
you get the breakout you get the consolidation you get pushup one two 3 4
11:57
days run the laws and then pushes on higher okay so whoever thought they were
12:02
in a position to short this may have found short success but it was it wasn't for a
12:09
sustainable period of time and price pushes high so the the the point I'm trying to make is when you get a move up
12:15
is that you will see some classic continuation pattern where price trends higher makes these shallow
12:20
consolidations small flag pattern and then you get a break up of higher okay I don't want to be fading
12:26
this ultimately okay you could get a breakdown reclaim
12:31
back above and then it pushes higher again I don't want to be fading that so just something to be just
12:37
something to be aware of and and equally I'm not trying to time the top here I'm looking at price and i' I've had several
12:43
attempts uh not several attempts I've probably mapped out several uh instances
12:49
of price where I've identified a again you have to understand when you're in a
12:54
Range B environment especially your breakout you have to appreciate that that that the environment that you're in
13:01
has shifted you're not going to get that perfect retest or that perfect pullback in a trending environment so you know
13:07
some of the levels I marked out is that this was one example of of price action right where I recall some something like
13:15
this and all I'm looking for is look I'm not saying price is going to come down here I'm saying if price comes down here
13:22
and it holds that's my reason to go along but at the end of the day there's a difference between looking for the
13:28
setup and the setup to actually give you a reason to trade price but you need to see the setup come to fruition first and
13:35
did it come to fruition no it doesn't but at the end of the day like I said sometimes you just have to be patient in
13:40
in in trading your system trading your setups and like I said I'm fairly comfortable about the fact that I hold a
13:46
spot position I'm not chasing price I have no fear of missing out uh if you've been following the streams then you
13:53
you'll know my thoughts from September onwards and now it's just a case of right well moving forward I can see
13:59
Bitcoin is trending higher where is the next likely logical level that Bitcoin is likely to trade and where can I
14:06
potentially look for uh a trade setup and I think in this instance it's it's
14:12
very difficult I certainly wouldn't be chasing this up here I think price has pushed away extensively uh Bitcoin has
14:17
broken out of the range for the best part of 7 eight n days and you just have to let the trend play out until you get
14:23
that leverage flush where if you look at previous examples um we looked at
14:28
Bitcoin coin in 2021 all right we broke above uh into
14:34
new alltime highs and look at this for a move down okay very fast aggressive move and then
14:40
price trades within the range it's this type of price action that I feel or that I believe that we will see at some point
14:48
over the coming weeks and generally for those of you who are around when Bitcoin Trends up okay
14:55
altcoins kind of get left behind and it's only when Bitcoin push prints a corrective structure so
15:02
what happens is G what I'm looking for now moving head heading into December is
15:07
if Bitcoin is to to trade and and print a local top I think we will get some sort of a cascading liquidation move
15:15
down where late Longs have piled in into price into Bitcoin looking for prices to go higher and they're probably likely to
15:21
get squeezed out or rinsed out or or liquidated whatever you want to call it okay we probably see some level of open
15:27
Interest being uh wiped out but what happens in this instance is you find that altcoins will will will drop
15:35
they could potentially drop 10 20 30% over a matter of days and when they drop
15:40
on bitcoin manages to find support what you want to be looking for at that point is strength strength in eth BTC you want
15:47
to see Bitcoin dominance coming off and then you want to see altcoins finding a level of support Wix being printed into
15:54
a demand Zone and that is the opportunity that I'm looking for from trading uh a Futures account for my spot
16:01
position on altcoins I'm very comfortable I've I've probably got 70 80% of my allocated altcoin exposure
16:08
into spot plays okay I've left about 25 30% ammunition for those Dreadful down
16:16
days which caus a lot of fear in the market to actually position into altcoins and that's been my stance I've
16:21
been relatively aggressive in my viewpoints like come Q4 come September
16:27
October I want to be position ing into alt coins we have bled from March April
16:32
May June July August September 7 months of slow rotational price action
16:40
to the downside on altcoins and having clearly stated that
16:45
now is the time I'm looking for opportunity because we've seen some 70 80% pullbacks in altcoins so now that
16:51
I've positioned in my into my spot plays I'm just speaking out Al loud my my mindset my my thought process what I'm
16:58
looking for and I and I do believe that eventually at some point Bitcoin will
17:03
give a corrective move down something similar to this okay and when it does
17:09
it's going to present what I believe will be good buying opportunities on altcoins okay so that's kind of how I'm
17:15
thinking about price I'm not chasing price I'm not looking to run rush into altcoins I'm not looking to overly
17:21
aggressively trade uh perpetuals or Futures it's just letting price come to me let those uh flushes come into
17:29
effective it might be a week it might be two weeks from now but when they when they do occur they give you some of the
17:35
best risk to reward opportunities okay as opposed to chasing price and then getting blown out of position which we
17:41
see quite often quite frequently people lose a [ __ ] ton of money you've got to put your risk management first but
17:48
having an aggressive stance when you do have those opportunities that you're ready you're mentally ready and you know
17:54
exactly which pairs you want to Target go ahead and start scaling into those positions
18:00
okay is that clear is there any questions around the the uh the kind of the thought process more
18:07
than anything um that I've
18:18
discovered let me just have a look through the chat we're just going to have a fairly casual session today there's not really that many trading
18:23
setups that are coming to my attention at this moment in time
18:34
we'll cover alt coins shortly all right let's move on so i' I've kind of given my thought process on bitcoin it it is
18:39
in price Discovery it is in PRI uh you know it is in a trending environment uh
18:44
let's move on to perhaps some of the um moving averages
18:52
next so let's look at the EXO Trend scanner which is the 1225 and
18:58
again start think off on the weekly what's the first thing that you
19:05
can remember about what I said with the 12s and 25s when you get this level of
19:10
compression okay but the price action is relatively close to the bands it's not
19:18
pushing away the minute you see a reclaim you've got to flip any bearish biases into a bullish
19:24
bias and if you look at what's happened since we've covered this scenario I gave you plenty of examples of these types of
19:31
structures on SPX on NASDAQ on bitcoin previously down here at 20 uh 20 25k
19:38
when it traded below the bands I personally thought at the time that Bitcoin once it lost these bands was
19:44
likely to trade lower down where I have to shift my bias is when price pushed above the bounds okay that's when I
19:50
shifted my contextual bias that okay above 30k I've got to get bullish simple as that October November uh 2023
19:59
was the point that I had to accept that there was a shift in structure and that was it the rest was history okay so
20:05
again looking at this there's no real reason for me to to to look in to to look to this to to fade this I'm looking
20:12
for buying opportunities and even if that buying opportunity means that Bitcoin all right let's just assume
20:17
worst case scenario it tops out here it pulls back okay there's a fairly good probable chance that we're going to get
20:24
a range man environment like this and this is the condition where I believe altcoins Thrive the most same again
20:30
happened from February all the way through to May two three months of price action in a Range allow altcoins
20:38
to continue their aggressive momentum to the upside and we saw some of the best altcoin price action in 2021 okay so
20:48
again we've had six months of price action here what surprised me about this was that when Bitcoin rallied altcoins
20:55
rallied with Bitcoin at the time and I honestly thought that with Bitcoin ranging in this zone for 6 months I
21:02
generally thought that's going to be a prime condition for altcoins to continue trending higher but again we have to
21:08
trade what the price is displayed on the chart and we have to go with what we've been presented with now looking ahead
21:16
we've had a second breakout of this range so again I'm just trying to understand or appreciate that when
21:22
Bitcoin does eventually establish a range B environment I think that's going to be a prime opportunity
21:29
for trading gold coins and just looking back if you look at Bitcoin in terms of when it breaks out of these ranges into
21:34
a trend let me just bring up a different
21:43
chart you can count the candles from a breakout period so basically look rangeb
21:49
environment and it's only a matter of weeks that you see aggressive acceleration and then price finally
21:55
finds a balanced environment where price Trad a a range B environment again okay
22:01
so 80% of the time price will Trend sorry 80% of the time price will range
22:06
and 20% of the time price will Trend so again looking at this breakout strated 1 2 3 4 five six six weeks of trended
22:14
Market in a Range okay break out again 1 2 3 4 5 6 weeks of a trend in a Range by
22:20
environment 6 months range six months uh six weeks of trend six weeks of trend
22:26
multi- weeks of uh range B VAR so again same again when we broke above the 2020 alltime the 2017 alltime highs
22:36
one 2 3 4 weeks of trend 1 2 3 4 5 weeks of
22:42
consolidation 1 2 3 4 okay five and then push up one two weeks of trend 1 2 3 4 5
22:48
6 7 8 9 10 12 12 weeks of consolidation and it's in these periods where you see altcoins really perform well for as long
22:56
as Bitcoin establishes a range right I just want to make that really really clear what to look for when you can
23:02
expect that shift of momentum into altcoins or generally from what I've understood over previous Cycles that's
23:09
the time when I really look to flor it on
23:15
altcoins so at this current juncture we see we've had one two 3 weeks of trending price action are we likely to
23:22
see a fourth next week before we get some level of pullback into a range B environment
23:28
okay if so then I really do like the opportunity being presented on altcoins
23:34
for the period heading into December I just want to make sure that
23:41
you've all understood the points I'm trying to illustrate and why I'm really excited about the opportunity for the
23:48
month ahead okay let's have a look at some of the uh oscillators now the thing with
23:54
oscillators in the trending environment and and this is a great example your
24:00
oscillators in these trending environments can remain overbought or
24:05
oversold longer than you can anticipate okay so just I'm not going to
24:11
delve too much into that you you you can back back test this when you look at these trending environments how price
24:18
behaves okay stays oscillated at the highs for a good look at the October
24:24
November all all the way through to December December oscillates to the downside whilst oscillating to the
24:30
downside what is priceing Consolidated in the range that's generally a bullish indication of price
24:44
action okay same on the RSI well let's have a look at the RSI on on the
24:50
weekly again I think this has got ample room to
24:56
continue pushing higher look at we we barely traded below the 5050 level
25:03
this on the right hand side of September October the sign the early signs were
25:09
there of you want to be looking for risk on look for long opportunities which is
25:15
what we covered okay so again I'm looking at the RSI there's no real concern there for me I think this still
25:21
has room to go higher into the 85 86 87s all right if we look at the macd this is the
25:28
one that's really interesting because we've just come out of uh a macd cross
25:36
into into into a bullish Trend and this is on the weekly this was in October so I still think there's that there's still
25:42
good opportunity for price to to potentially Trend higher up into that
25:48
110 120 whether it does that remains to be seen but from all everything that I look at you have to understand that when
25:56
presented with a a corrective move down down it's probably likely to be shortlived very similar to this and you
26:02
will see Trend continuation higher the key thing for me is EXO how do you time
26:08
tops what do you look for in in getting out of the market so I think we'll cover
26:13
that on Sunday I'm going to go over methods of how I identify distribution how I identify tops uh and I'll give you
26:20
a full breakdown the five step process that I have for identifying tops but for now what I'm trying to tell you is that
26:26
I don't really see any significant downside risk other than we may get a corrective move down and if we do get a
26:32
corrective move down you've got to be looking for buying opportunities I feel on on bitcoin and altcoin from a trading
26:37
perspective that is okay right okay now let's move on to I'm
26:43
going to start with E PTC because this is very very interesting for me I absolutely love this chart I've waited
26:50
forever and a day to get bullish on E BTC um believe it or not I I had again
26:59
this is a wild prediction I think back in 2022 I was genuinely calling for eth BTC
27:06
to come trade into the 3935 level it's on my timeline somewhere
27:12
low and behold um to my surprise I have to say that we
27:18
actually got there as well uh I I didn't think we would get there this year because of the bullish price action we
27:24
saw on bitcoin but nevertheless if you just take
27:29
this key swing low of 2019 to the highs of 2021 look at where
27:36
we pull back into the December uh sorry the the
27:43
um almost the uh the April 2021
27:49
open into the 786 and what I'm looking for on this is
27:56
It's only thir day today so if this happens to
28:02
close as on and that was on the monthly if this happens to close as what what do you think I'm
28:09
going to say next what type of candle structure do you think I'm looking for this to close as as as a potential
28:16
reversal signal into the 786 into the weekly demand Zone in terms of risk to
28:23
reward I could not ask for a better setup I generally couldn't this is a Fant fantastic risk reward
28:32
setup God candle yeah Jeff nice try not I mean it could be a god candle but I'm
28:37
looking for a weekly pin bar close here and I think if we get that and
28:43
Bitcoin happens to pull back over the next week or so what you want to be looking for is for this to start pushing
28:51
up and when it does all this price action that you've seen since May June July August
28:59
September October November December I my guess and this is again
29:06
guess the mations I think we just do this one big
29:11
candle you're going to get a pullback and then a second expansion candle all the way back
29:20
up It's Not Unusual to see this type of behavior where price after bleeding for
29:25
so many weeks finds the bottom and then the people are starting to unwind their
29:31
short Hedges shorts are going to puke people are going to pile into Longs the momentum is going to pick up and that's
29:37
why you see these fast reversals often at this key inflection point so heading
29:43
into December I'm very very excited about the possible potential opportunity
29:49
ahead on ethereum okay I absolutely love this setup couldn't generally just couldn't
29:55
ask for anything better weekly demand Zone into the 786 closing as a potential uh weekly pin
30:02
bar let's go over the next few weeks and I think with that you were probably likely to see
30:10
continuation on altcoins and I think the key to all of this is should Bitcoin
30:16
give a corrective move down and consolidate within the range or does
30:21
Bitcoin continue trending higher and everything just moves in tandem together
30:27
so there are the two that I'm I'm on the look at my preferred scenario is Bitcoin giving a pullback ranging for a few
30:32
weeks then going higher similar to what we saw in January 2021 and then altcoins
30:37
obviously doing their own
30:50
thing even on the monthly chart this is a monthly demand zone so I I really hope
30:55
this is the the end of the seller exhaustion like this is essentially sellers exhausted at this point we''re
31:02
seeing a fairly decent reaction on The Daily time frame I think for me this this L the
31:09
November monthly open or December monthly open is going to be key for me here to really think about being
31:15
aggressive you've got it round about here so yeah above 35 I think it's going
31:23
to get very interesting if you look at this we've had a ball signal back into a
31:29
bare signal this is on the daily time frame this is the daily bands I'm looking for a fast uh
31:37
aggressive reaction out of here over the coming weeks then I'm looking for a higher
31:43
low and then I think we see some sort of rounded
31:50
structure okay and then continuation higher at least back into 05s up into
31:56
this level here that will be fairly sufficient and that will lead to some
32:01
continued aggression in terms of momentum to the upside on on E usdt so now that we're underneath
32:08
usdt starting on the monthly chart let's just zoom out again when I've talked about price
32:16
action into a demand Zone what do you recognize here we've covered this week in week out
32:23
every stream since September that look at what the candles are telling you buyers again stepping into the market
32:31
despite all the eth bashing that we've seen on the timeline I've been
32:38
advocating the fact that I've been a buyer on ethereum from the laws of 2200
32:44
2300 2400 we got the break above 3,000 okay now we had we've had a fairly
32:51
shallow consolidation and I'm looking for continuation higher now if e BTC catches a
32:56
bit I generally think there's a very very good chance that we will eventually see e BTC trade back up into 4,800 4,900
33:05
I don't really see this offering any strong level of resistance or giving any
33:11
concern we'll have to see when we get there you know price May trade up into the level right but um ultimately I'm
33:18
looking for continuation higher over the next several weeks and one thing you have to appreciate if you look at
33:24
Bitcoin if you just look at the Bitcoin chart
33:31
we were at 68,000 on the 4th of November it's now
33:37
the 21st of November literally 15 days later look how much price has pushed up
33:43
when price trends it absolutely [ __ ] goes okay and and I think it catches
33:48
many people by surprise the the unexpected
33:54
momentum of how aggressive crypto Trends can be because we're so accustomed to seeing price action rotate in a Range
34:02
continue rotating in a Range chopp your price action Traders getting chopped up but if you've played this sensibly and
34:09
if you've kind of positioned yourself into an ethereum I think it's inevitable
34:14
that eventually price will catch up and continue going higher in this instance now in terms of range bound price action
34:20
you know I want to talk about the fact that I don't really use ranges in a low
34:26
time frame environment when markets are trending I only use ranges on the macro
34:31
context so again taking the high time frame level here you've got the range highs of
34:37
November 2021 you've got these significant lows this was the high into the significant
34:44
low before price bounced this is the range level took me the best part of 20
34:50
10 seconds to identify it's not difficult to understand where the price points are that's more or less the range
34:57
that I'm looking to work from one zone to the next in the in the context of a trending
35:03
Market this was the area that I've covered over many streams and on the
35:09
timeline play by play exactly where I'm buying why I'm buying what I'm looking for as far back as uh August September
35:17
when price was here I talked about the fact that look for pullbacks into this level look for consolidation look for a
35:22
base to to develop and then if you look on the left hand side here this is all a
35:28
thin efficient move on the way down you should expect to price you should expect price to push back up into this level
35:34
very very quickly it's come back up into that Supply Zone
35:39
okay now looking at the EMAs um or the the trend scanner again
35:46
this really simplifies the process of when not to fade the trend and when to look for
35:52
momentum and I I I get it from time to time you know people can get caught offside or looking to show the market
35:58
but when you see this look at this you've had a bull bull market crossover in November
36:05
2023 and then all we've done is bleed for 6 months but look at this
36:10
consolidation and compression look at that expansion above okay at this point you should have
36:15
recognized the compression of the Bands the fact that price is not breaking down this is a trend
36:21
environment is this really a trending environment at these lows no it's not
36:26
it's a consolid phase it could break down but you have a clear invalidation point but now we've seen expansion to
36:33
the upside so I think it's only a matter of time whereby any pullbacks that are presented by the market if Bitcoin pulls
36:40
back will give you a shallow pullback and then you're going to see continuation higher again I'm already long from this from 3150 along with my
36:48
spot position now if Bitcoin let's just assume Bitcoin does pull back I'm not
36:53
saying it will do it could continue going higher but if it does you've got to look for a shallow pull back here and
36:58
then continuation higher to take out these highs okay there's your range quarter range highs mid-range range lows
37:07
okay pullback maybe we get a slightly deeper pullback I personally can't see it maybe into the bands okay the bands
37:13
maybe push up but this is the Zone 2900 3,000 if there is a pullback that's the
37:18
level that I'd want to see a reaction pushing up into 4,000 okay looking for
37:23
those big swing trades into December if something changes fundamental L then I'll notify you on the next stream or on
37:29
the timeline that I've changed my view but until that happens I'm looking for reasons to to continue being long in the
37:35
market I don't really see any reason to Show ALT coins whatsoever okay and that's kind of been my view for the best
37:42
part of the last several months and if you really want to refine
37:48
this on the lower time frame okay I've just shown you the that the high time frame range if you really want to take this further you can do throughout the
37:56
context of this range in itself just localizing the higher time frame
38:02
range in this relative environment okay and you're already above the mid-range here at this
38:08
point just about so again I I I talked about the fact that
38:14
ultimately or essentially I want to see price uh hold if you remember on the
38:21
timeline last week I talked about the fact that I want to see price hold the 29 level I don't mind a pushing to 28
38:28
but it has to be shortlived very very shortlived we got that we got the consolidation under the mid-range
38:33
pushing up that's your expansion should take out these highs trade this then this and then this Okay so we've got all
38:40
this Zone up here to trade into so any pullbacks now if they are presented into
38:47
3,000 or 3100s or maybe it's a pull below the level back above that's your trigger to go in first Target 36ers
38:54
second target which I think is fairly probable 4,000 if the momentum is strong in the
39:00
market is that clear let's move on to Total two or
39:07
let's look at total which has made a new all-time high so again using these high
39:12
time frame contextual charts my objective is again purely predictive
39:18
purely uh objective is that I do believe there's a good opport I think there's a good chance Bitcoin sorry not Bitcoin
39:24
but the total market cap can raise up to 3 75 maybe it tops at the four maybe it tops at five I don't know but ultimately
39:32
what how I use this now is is essentially let's just assume worst case
39:39
scenario this is the top of the market gets back inside failure to get
39:44
acceptance gives me no reason for continuation on the long side failure to get
39:50
acceptance gives me caution to think about all right how much deeper can this pull back is it just a corrective move
39:55
into here into this range quarter and we get a push back up fine long here stop
40:01
below here not that you can trade this chart but it's a context of what's happening through the entirety of the
40:08
market cap the total market cap and the overall Market it's kind of the birds I view for the market yes you're going to
40:14
get certain coins that run as anomalies certain meme coins certain [ __ ] certain low caps on salana but
40:20
ultimately it gives me my high time frame context when I'm trading futures of perss those more liquid pairs a
40:26
higher Market market cap pairs that I'm looking to trade so it's it's very very encouraging
40:34
to see this push up into new all-time highs um and again if there is a pullback on bitcoin maybe it's going to
40:40
be very very shallow maybe the pullback is just into that three3 trillion uh dollar level okay
40:48
we're at 3.22 so maybe we just see 200 billion wipe out and then consolidate
40:54
and we see continuation higher okay that's kind of the pullback that I'm hoping for to get into position on
41:01
purose okay I've got my spot positions I'm very happy I'm now looking at
41:06
playing the trend on altcoins over the coming weeks if they set
41:13
up let's look at total two again you've got to go with a trend
41:20
continuation simple
41:25
tools look at what the uh look what the macr trend scanner has just done on a weekly time frame and if you look back
41:33
okay it doesn't give too much noise where you get the most noise is in these
41:38
range B environments but even then it's every several months this was
41:44
in May it flagged bearish in September it flagged bullish in February
41:50
shortlived because of the covid crash it flag bullish back in May but look at what can happen in Trend b in a trending
41:56
environment irent okay same again we we got the Bear Cross here slightly late because for those of you who followed my
42:03
streams back in 2021 I was out of the market by this point the minute I see this look at this Rally from the origin
42:11
correction this was January February where altcoins really took off into March April May the minute I see this in
42:18
into November December that was enough for me to start short in the market okay and then we get the the signal on the
42:25
weekly slightly late but that's your real shift in in in contextual structure
42:30
that there's some serious concerns about downside risk and you get the trend down
42:35
but look at the period of red and then in range bound this is where you're going to get the chop okay the the the rotational aspects from from bullish to
42:42
bearish bullish to bearish now if you look at this we've had the bll signal for the
42:49
best part of several months we've had a slow corrective bleed down very shortlived phase of a big
42:57
bearish indicator okay doesn't NE doesn't necessarily mean that the market
43:03
is bearish it's just an indicator it's just telling you that price is below the 12 and the 2 12 and the 25 em is but
43:11
look at this now I'm looking for expansion over the coming weeks any pullbacks or opportunities to go along
43:19
and if you look at trending markets again as I've covered on bitcoin when
43:24
you break out of a range like this or like uh this here there's your range B
43:31
environment or like this here look at the expansion that follows Relentless
43:36
rapid expansion to the upside so I'm going with price action I'm looking to
43:42
trade the trend okay look at this consolidation expansion consolidation expansion above here any pullbacks I'm
43:49
looking for acceleration to the highs trade Above This level here you've got absolutely no
43:55
resistance up until these high so we may see a level of Correction here but you
44:00
want it to be shortlived under this resistance level the minute you see acceptance above you've got to go with with the momentum and the aggression to
44:07
the upside unless you get a unless you get a a deviation or a swing failure where it gets back inside then we'll have to assess that given situation and
44:14
it's the same on total 3 as well we're now pushing above this key
44:19
level here we flipped bullish in September you've got to go with the bands again any pullbacks in a trending
44:26
Market buying opportunity continuation higher
44:33
okay so now that we've covered the high time frame context we've quoted Bitcoin we've qued
44:39
ethereum total total two total three uh let's move on to salana
44:45
which is surprise surprise um for those of you who watch My Stream in 2021 and
44:51
for those of you again who have followed me on the timeline uh this was never
44:57
distributive at all in my opinion never distrib distributive this is that one
45:02
structure that I've taught time and time again compression multiple tests of a trend
45:07
line eventually you will see a clearance thrust Above This level this is the this
45:13
is what you want to be anticipating on the tail side of this uh compression and you get expansion and eventually we
45:19
should well we're at alltime highs aren't we there we go I think we we've
45:25
literally pipped of trade of the alltime high in salana so again if there is a correction over the coming days or weeks
45:32
then you want to be looking at this daily low here or weekly low so Mark out
45:37
your weekly lows and highs and your monthly opens okay and I I think I'll cover that on Sunday stream we'll talk
45:43
about weekly opens daily opens Mondays ranges and how I use those in a trend
45:49
Trend in environment how I use ranges in a trending environment looking for trade
45:55
execution so what the main focus of today's stream is and this is going to be a segue for Sunday's stream it's
46:00
Thursday already so it's another two three days is how I then look for execution how I'm looking for trade
46:06
entries in a trend environment so I'm trying to set the foundations and the contextual structures in this stream and
46:13
then on Sunday's stream we we'll start nailing some trade setups okay so I think Sunday stream is going to be a
46:19
really good one if you're looking for some trade setups that I'm looking to trade then you certainly want to tune
46:24
into that one okay let's have look at some altcoins
46:31
um altcoins are held for for quite some time vanry is one that I've held I think
46:36
it's a layer one it's a AI it's gaming narrative it's presented another
46:43
opportunity for me it's one that I've been positioning since November I actually was in the Ico of vanry it used
46:50
to be uh formerly known as tvk back in 2021 um I think it went from 4 cents to
46:55
120 back then then they rebranded to vanry vanry chain through a layer one now with AI gaming um and a few other
47:02
bits and Bobs in in in the pipeline but again I'm looking at these types of structures you've got low lower low this has to be the
47:11
higher low looking for that expansion up into 14 cents and then eventually into
47:17
23 cents whoops that's the swing trade that I'm looking for into here okay
47:23
there's nothing more to it than that you can look at the oscillators you can
47:28
look at whatever you want but essentially if there's a pull back into this 08 or 7 or 6 I may take one more
47:35
stab adding to my position looking for expansion to 14 and then to 23
47:43
um that's that one done um let me look at Tower because that's an interesting one in terms of AI Tower is another
47:51
interesting one which I I believe for now is in a Range B environment and I'm looking for their expansion above the
47:57
range this is a clean set of lows here and we've got a clean set of highs
48:04
uh over at 6 and 80 so again High time
48:10
frame chart if this is a corrective structure we've had the breakout we've we're
48:15
looking for this now to be some form of a corrective structure okay into a range into a trend
48:22
continuation higher that's what i' be looking for uh we'll go to GTO because I remember sharing the setup on Jito if
48:29
you recall where were we buying this we were literally talking about this at the low several streams ago okay I talked
48:36
about mapping out the uh monthly op so if I just go to
48:41
EXO EXO opens is it let me
48:47
see yeah monthly opens okay so again my
48:52
point on the stream was the fact that I I talked about how this resembled whiff okay let's just
48:59
go back to the whiff
49:07
example do you remember when when I talked about how many coins I feel are
49:12
lagging Al many structures are lagging what whiff did so you had a low you had
49:17
a lower low and then you had this consolidation range okay you're looking for price to trade into the mid and
49:23
remember what I talked about here that watch people are going to say this is a DV ation and you're targeting the lows
49:29
instead you got a correction to the mid I talked about longing in this Zone and
49:34
when you see price push above here what did I talk about thinning efficiency once price gets above here it's not
49:39
going to [ __ ] around it's going to rip through this level very very quickly that's essentially what you had okay
49:44
take profit my stop stop stop cells uh limit cells got hit I'm out the position
49:49
we're now back into that mid-range so if there is one more drop down back above that's
49:56
going to be good enough for me to get along looking for continuation higher okay so that's kind of what I'm thinking
50:01
about so I'll cover this on Sunday stream but looking at the structal context is what I want to focus on when
50:08
we look at GTO um again you've got this low price holding the lows it's above
50:14
the monthly opens okay this was the zone that I talked about where I'm scaling
50:20
into position it's going to take several weeks several several months before we see the the fruits or this come to
50:26
fruition and inevitably I am looking to trade this back towards a high so I'm still holding my spot position I've been
50:32
in for the best part of seven eight weeks now uh we're almost at the mid-range okay so it doesn't come as a
50:37
surprise that we're at the mid-range at this point uh and I think it's clear contextually if you're already in this
50:42
position well done uh you you want to be looking for higher prices over the coming weeks into December that's a very
50:49
nice trade from I think my average is around about $192 so into five you know 150% move risk the reward whatever you
50:56
want to call it Jupiter was another one very similar structure beautiful price action slam
51:02
straight into the mid-range took my profit I'm now looking for an entry to get back into position again whether
51:07
that's one more push down into 95s into that November monthly open back test the
51:12
November monthly open if it goes deeper I'm just going to add to my position and looking for price to trade back into the
51:17
mid and then we can start trading into the $2 level that's kind of the structure that I'm looking for so again
51:24
everything I'm talking about is not really Horning on the execution aspect it's more about look at the structural
51:30
aspects just look at the moving averages if if you struggle to understand what price is
51:36
doing go to the Daily there's the daily Trend go to the weekly there's a bullish crossover why are you trying to feed
51:42
this why are you trying to short this anybody who's trying to short this [ __ ] I feel
51:52
is trading against the trend I I I I think it's it doesn't warrant shorts in
51:59
this type of price action I think when you look at the risk to reward you've got all this potential price action to
52:05
trade to the upside the fact that we've bled for so many months and the first thing that you want to think about is
52:10
shorting because of the fact that we've just had expansion from these lows I I don't think that's the context you've
52:16
got to go with Market structure you've got to go with the trend let's look at Tia because that's
52:22
another one that I've positioned into again this is a really good example of
52:28
something that's structurally [ __ ] or was structurally screwed but now okay we
52:34
are getting getting this bottoming structure I've been adding to my
52:39
position at that $4 level $4 $450 my current entry is around about 460 now
52:44
I've been citing this for like six seven weeks okay and again look at the daily
52:50
we will now start seeing I believe we we should start seeing the shift or I
52:55
shouldn't talking certainties but we want to be looking for a push into a higher high higher low higher high and
53:03
then you can see then you will probably see that acceleration into the mid and some into $15 $16 okay that's what I'd
53:10
be looking for inv validation for me is clearly at the L if we if we lose this for whatever reason into December then
53:16
structurally I think that's not just going to be a tier alone I think it's going to be across the board okay but
53:24
for now you've got this multimon range B environment I've been accumulating my
53:30
spot position the minute we get a push out of this with a pullback then I'm going to bring out the Futures purpose
53:36
play and look for Trend continuation on a Futures account another one is
53:43
say been beautiful to trade I traded this from the lws I talked about it in the timeline I've traded at level to
53:50
level zero hindsight I've talked about where where I've hedged I've talked about the pull back into the higher low
53:56
close Okay we get the push up now we're resting got this monthly
54:01
open I'm looking for any form of I'm still in position by the way but I'm
54:07
looking for any forms of if we get a push lower down maybe this range here
54:12
that's the range that I'm looking to trade or looking to position so that I can take this higher
54:19
and again not only am I looking at this from a a a range perspective you could
54:24
essentially draw looking at the moving averages but also a trend line okay so
54:31
even if you just clear the chart maybe just use a trend line maybe use just use a
54:36
channel whatever works for you use multiple points of
54:47
Confluence so if we do get a pullback if Bitcoin does pull back maybe we're going to pull back into this Zone here
54:56
and then push up again into 65 cents you don't have to use a range you can use a trend line right there there's many ways
55:03
you can play this so what I generally do is I I have my high time frame ranges mapped out let me just get rid of this
55:10
that's my high time frame range and what I generally would do is use trend lines
55:15
because I'm looking for that shift in Trend I'm looking for that shift in acceleration and if you recall the
55:21
pattern that I've shared over the last last week or two do
55:27
you remember this when I've talked about this what generally what you see is compression price pushing away doing
55:33
something like this this is that continuation that you want right here and then you get that
55:40
fast expansion to the upside this is what I'm looking for across the board on on various
55:49
structures and you will see this play out time and time again many of you will
55:54
be waiting for the perfect play pull back into this consolidation and what does price do in a trending environment
56:00
you're never going to get the perfect pullback but this is where Trends come into play channels trend lines moving
56:07
averages go with the momentum you're not going to get the perfect pullback unless there's a big cascading event on bitcoin
56:14
which is going to effect have the dominant effect on on altcoins as well okay so I covered this structure on the
56:20
timeline next one is uh an altcoin that I've positioned into uh for transparency
56:26
I've bought a position on the market at $1 and I've also got a uh OTC position
56:33
which is vested for the next six months okay so this is slightly more of a a hybrid play for me where I've I've got a
56:40
trade position uh I receed a portion of my token up tokens up front but I invested for a significant portion of my
56:48
tokens until April I think so this is one of those deep in narratives I'm really betting on Meme
56:55
coins uh Ai and deep in uh deep in narrative
57:01
they're the three narratives that I'm really betting on and obviously trading Futures and perss on say sui tier that's
57:08
kind of where I'm going to be looking to do my per play but I'm I'm looking to position into altcoins that are at that
57:14
100 200 300 million market cap level that can go on to 1 billion two billion 3 billion given a 3 to 5x multiplier so
57:23
again having positioning from a dollar uh I think this is round about I think this is around about what 120 million
57:28
market cap let me just check so it's kind of a hybrid where I've got positions on say I've got positions on
57:35
tier I've got ethereum Bitcoin salana right they're my spot positions I've got a load of uh mid midcaps and then I've
57:41
got some degenerate plays on on low caps as well so looking at anyone
57:57
so again when I look at this I see 160 million market cap 93 market cap decent
58:03
trading volume price relatively in a rangeb environment inevitably at some point I
58:11
suspect if the market is bullish we'll see price break from this range bound
58:16
environment on the local time frame back into the mid above into 17s and I think
58:21
when you look at the market cap that's why I'm looking for these plays that can go from 100 to 500 million market caps
58:27
they're the type of players that I'm trying to identify vanry is one this is another one having spoken to the team
58:33
I've been quite impressed uh and that's all there is to it okay so when I when I think of other coins in this sector and
58:39
I look at Helium I look at a cash Network I think this has got great potential to to capture some of that
58:45
market share so that's why um I've positioned and that's why I've put my money into this position okay so it's
58:51
not um that's up to you if you want to follow me that's up to you it's not Financial advice ultimately okay but
58:57
trying to give you my reasoning behind this um Kai because a lot of people are asking me about Kai it's one of those
59:03
meme coins again I've been buying at the lows okay I I really want to see this do
59:08
well because I want to do a giveaway on stream at some point towards the end of the year if this can trade one1 to $2
59:14
then I'll probably do a couple thousand giveaways on stream with my Kai tokens like here you are he's a gift uh but
59:22
yeah it moves fast but I'm just disappointed that it's really retraced the inter of the
59:28
move so a bit more patience required on this I was hoping that with the whole cat meme narrative this would go to have
59:35
performed better but um we'll see frog is an interesting one SC has been all over
59:41
this I'm looking to get into position um I actually had this mapped out for my
59:48
personal self [Music] um touch and go I've got a small
59:54
position in this but I am looking to to add to that position I've just got 20%
59:59
of my position I'm slightly underwater my average cost is 46 47 cents I'm
1:00:05
essentially looking for that structure that I've shared with you time and time again it it's basically this um do you
1:00:11
guys remember this one here where I've shared this where you've got this kind of like reaccumulation structure what
1:00:16
happens is price does this takes out these lows and then it
1:00:21
just rips to the upside literally like a prints of 50 % move so I'm looking for
1:00:27
something similar in terms of continuation structure here I don't know if this is it there's two levels that
1:00:33
stand out for me this is one level
1:00:38
here okay on the other level if that fails it's going to be around about the
1:00:45
30 31 cence level so I'm going to be aggressive uh if Bitcoin starts rolling
1:00:52
over then I'll have to cut the position because then I think I that in that case I think we trade into
1:00:59
32s okay and take out all these lows then I'm looking for continuation higher
1:01:05
otherwise run these levs here give me consolidation and I think we print
1:01:11
something like that that's the two structures that I'm looking for I'm wrong below 20 uh 28
1:01:18
cents all right let's look at B because some of you guys keep asking me about B so it's been a wild ride I understand
1:01:28
it's an interesting one um it's a high high risk High reward ESS called it at
1:01:35
sub 1 million market cap it's done nearly 200x so big shout out to SC and SC
1:01:41
members who caught this um for
1:01:48
me just give me a second let me um bring up a different chart
1:02:03
I think what's impressed me about Bert is the fact
1:02:10
that how can I do this without [ __ ] up all right okay
1:02:22
cool just give me one second
1:02:41
we'll do it this way okay so looking up you have to appreciate the fact that look if you are um chasing the hype if
1:02:54
you're not froming down here and chasing the hype you're playing a dangerous game because this is very very volatile it it
1:03:00
traded from 1 million market cap to 170 180 that's nearly 180x for those people
1:03:06
who got in early I got in got I I personally had a small position and then I bought a big bigger chunk at 20
1:03:13
million market capup so even then I'm still up somewhat uh I've taken some profits I've been trading this range
1:03:19
because it has been volatile but I think looking all honestly I'm not sure what's going to happen that's the honest truth
1:03:26
um I'm not going to say to you go out there and buy B I'm just being really honest I don't know what's going to happen it could go to zero it could go
1:03:32
to 500 million market cap I think that's the beauty of meme coins you just don't know which meme coins are going to take
1:03:38
off right and the fact that this is traded 180 and it's come all the way back to 60 70 million market cap
1:03:44
shouldn't come as a surprise to you guys and I'll explain why because if you look at something like
1:03:49
retardo which I regret not buying because somebody shielded it to me at 20 million market cap several months go if
1:03:57
you look at something like retardo is there a better chart anywhere
1:04:02
that I can potentially use
1:04:09
or just give me a second I actually do regret not buying this I really wish I did but it is what
1:04:15
it is you can't catch them all right um let me just bring up some data on the
1:04:21
chart and just let me explain to you the context of meme coins what has essentially been happening
1:04:27
think all right this this will be a good example of what happens I find that with
1:04:35
meme coins they're very cyclical in nature and they're very aggressive it's not for the faint-hearted right when you
1:04:41
look at this S price action if you look at retardo which I own zero I don't have
1:04:46
any I'm not telling you to go out and buy this but if you look at this here it's tra it was trading around
1:04:53
about the uh 20 million Market C Level I think around here and look at this from 20 let's just call it 10 10 20 million
1:05:00
market cap it goes to 130 140 in a matter of weeks and it comes all the way
1:05:07
back down again into 20 million market cap at these lows this is where I got sh
1:05:12
retardo and I failed to buy like an idiot okay so it it's no surprised to
1:05:20
see these altcoins move up 70 uh you know print multiples of the up and then
1:05:26
retrace 70 80 90% consolidate and then go again for a high leg pull back really
1:05:31
deep consolidate and go again right it's it's it's it's been very very cyclical
1:05:38
very volatile but with that if you can time these lows you're going to get some fantastic opportunities and again I'm
1:05:46
going to give you one example of this and why I why I absolutely love trading mean coins at the moment because with a
1:05:52
small amount you know say for the sake of $5,000 uh hypothetically and something pulls a
1:05:58
10x in a matter of weeks you're up 50k right which is great for some people uh
1:06:04
but again looking at something like Forest right which I've been trading uh
1:06:09
I've absolutely love trading forest and again it's it's moving very very fast off certain
1:06:18
levels look at this structure here right and then look at Forest it's it's very iCal in nature I
1:06:27
remember buying this at 45 million market cap watching it go to 30 riding it all the way back down I didn't even
1:06:32
sell any of it then watching it go to uh 7080 I finally took some profit once I
1:06:38
started seeing uh signs of a swing F okay when I saw that at these highs that
1:06:44
was enough for me to get out I'm I've taken a small position I was hoping for a deeper pullback into that 20 Level it
1:06:51
didn't come but look at this it Wicked into a 10 million Mark well 20 million market cap and it's at 38 so 100% move
1:06:59
in a matter of days since yesterday actually it's fairly phenomenal but you have to have the risk appetite and the
1:07:06
risk tolerance to trade this [ __ ] um and if you get emotionally attached you're going to get chewed up rinse and spot
1:07:11
back out and you're going to wish you never touch these coins so just trade them with a little bit of caution okay
1:07:18
with a little Caution uh let me cover desync because I want to give a special thank you to
1:07:24
desync for sponsoring the stream with me which who I've also partnered with and I think when I look at the decent chart I
1:07:30
think this is around about 280 million market cap it's another deep in play so I've only got
1:07:35
two deep in plays now which is any1 and deep in they're my two ones that I'm backing I think let me just check on the
1:07:52
chart yeah this is 289 million market cap with a $2 million
1:07:59
trading volume um again I I I'm looking for this over the coming weeks and
1:08:05
months into December to trade significantly higher the fact that when
1:08:11
you look at the market here it's been range bound
1:08:17
from take these lows from 13 cents to 25 cents so looking for expansion or what
1:08:25
whether we get a pullback then expansion into the mid level into a trending Market range base consolidation want to
1:08:32
see fast aggressive two three four weeks of expansion to the upside okay same on
1:08:38
Zig Zig is another great play held holding up really really well if you
1:08:43
look at this road structure again this is why I've been advocating for Zig why I really like what the team are doing
1:08:51
they're very profitable they they're turning over profit month on month so the fundamental are good they've got 300
1:08:57
million uh locked in um fdv sorry the fdv is is around about 300 400 but they
1:09:04
have about 300 million locked in so looking at the structure
1:09:13
very similar to what I showed you on fog where you've got this roundedness comes back takes lows rips
1:09:20
either way consolidation and I'm looking for continuation higher okay that's what I'm looking for
1:09:25
and if you think about it the fact that the market sold off on November the
1:09:31
heading into the US elections right so with the market selling off into the US
1:09:37
elections it's reacted fairly aggressively 100% move almost post
1:09:42
election so and it's holding up as well so great show of strength clear back
1:09:47
above these highs and I think we do see a trend continuation higher
1:09:53
okay so there kind of the the position that I'm in I think pop cat is is is I
1:09:58
don't have any pop cat but I think looking at this CH I I personally wouldn't want to touch
1:10:03
this I'm being really honest I would not want to touch this
1:10:10
just simply because of the fact that it's rallied from September it's at $2 billion market
1:10:16
cap could it go higher yes but just to get a a double your money on this you
1:10:22
this has to go to 400 Sorry 4 billion market cap which is $4 so I I personally will pass on this not something that I
1:10:28
want to take where you want to see Pop cat is find acceptance back above 180 for
1:10:36
continuation higher okay Simon's Cat um I've I've never
1:10:43
really traded Simon's cart do okay we'll look at Doge because
1:10:51
that's an interesting one that I've traded yeah looks decent looks decent
1:10:57
feels slightly topper here with a wick so I wouldn't be surprised to see a pull back
1:11:02
into just just eyeballing K time frame
1:11:09
levels you got this Sr level and you got this Sr Lev so you got 27 or 33 34 but
1:11:16
again we'll cover we'll cover setups on Sunday stream guys look I want to wrap you up there I I think we've been on
1:11:22
stream for the best part of an hour on 15 um but I hope I really hope and pray
1:11:29
that we see continuation into December I'm very very excited it takes a lot for me to be bullish I've maintained my
1:11:36
bullish stance in 2024 the job isn't finished we've got to finish the year on a high we've got to
1:11:42
capitalize on altcoins trending and then the hard work comes in this is where I
1:11:47
feel I'm at my best is when if there's one thing I've done very
1:11:54
well on markets or over the last several years it's getting out at the highs and
1:11:59
shorting the market back down I think that's what I'm most known for or best known for is shorting markets being a
1:12:07
Perma bear call it what you want I call it risk management and I call it locking in gains locking in the profit and then
1:12:14
shorten the market on the way back down again okay so that's going to be my focus my job is to capitalize on the
1:12:21
markets over the next several weeks should the markets push higher and then I think we'll do two things on
1:12:28
Sunday uh I think the two things that I want to cover on Sunday is
1:12:35
one let me change this color what's this pink
1:12:43
[ __ ] one we'll talk about identifying distribution
1:12:50
distribution and the second part is looking for a uh exiting
1:12:57
lockets or signals I look for and the third one is
1:13:05
contextually shorting the market but prior to all of this okay I think this
1:13:10
is really important because what I'd like to do is give you something give
1:13:15
you the tools give you the uh the mindset that I
1:13:22
have of When I Look to exit Market why I I exit markets and when I take caution
1:13:28
heading into those exit points okay and then obviously if you want to take it one step further we'll touch very
1:13:35
briefly on shorting the market but prior to all of this okay the primary context
1:13:41
that I want to talk about on Sunday stream is trade setups in a trending
1:13:48
environment and we will also cover um the uh the private group I will be
1:13:55
running for 4 weeks starting in December I might defer
1:14:00
it until mid December but the purpose of the group is four weeks I'll be streaming two three times a week on a
1:14:07
private group it's free to well it's not a paid group uh it's signing up with my
1:14:12
exchange Partners where proceeds of the referral money is not for me I'm going to donate it to charity so it's just my
1:14:19
way of giving back to you guys I don't want your money I just want you know to help people out there uh I'm blessed to
1:14:26
be in this position to stream I get paid by my sponsors you guys get education for free I get to share my thoughts I'm
1:14:31
blessed to share my thoughts with you guys and I thought well what's a good way to raise some money for charity
1:14:37
that's not going to cost you guys anything so we'll run something up in December all right but apart from that
1:14:42
I'm going to wrap up here thank you for tuning in and hopefully hopefully we'll um we'll have
1:14:50
some exciting green candles over the coming weeks God bless take care and see you on Sunday
1:15:23
bye-bye e
