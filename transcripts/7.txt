all right we should be live welcome back it's uh Trader X once again with a weekly Bitcoin review or midweek I
0:33
should say how are you all and just before we proceed I just want to make sure that you can hear me okay and that
0:39
you can see my screen just give me a quick confirmation in the chat
0:57
please all right brilliant thank you very much good to see the usual faces um so in
1:04
today's stream we'll review Bitcoin and just a general uh of viw of the markets
1:09
but before we proceed as always anything said in today's video is not Financial
1:14
advice it is just my view of the market special shout out to my stream sponsors
1:20
okay exchange who have been a great platform and uh it's a platform that that I now
1:28
trade uh my crypto so um let's kick off on the stream first thing that we will
1:34
do is essentially focus on
1:40
bitcoin and in doing so um the first tool that I want to bring up is just
1:47
trading lights which is something that I use to check the uh aut books and kind
1:52
of heat map which is an overlay of where resting uh bids and asks are in the books essentially but there's really not
2:00
a great deal that's happening or or that has happened over the last several days it's it's we've been in this price range
2:07
for approximately I think 7 eight days now and I think you know it's just
2:12
waiting it's just a matter of waiting for price to resolve one way or another over the coming days I was hoping that
2:20
we would see some action heading into today's stream I I deferred Monday stream um decided to reschedule today
2:28
but here we are we're still contained within this rangeb environment where price is essentially being capped by
2:36
that 65 66k level uh and you can see in terms of the book depth there's around
2:41
about 7,000 uh Bitcoin um on the ask side and in terms
2:48
of support we're looking at anywhere between 61 to 62 in terms of depth so
2:54
it's evidently clear where price is currently kept so we've got a a spot of
2:59
bids pressing there between 59 and 60 uh then we've also got this segment here
3:04
between 61.5 and and 62 which is kind of containing price the majority of the
3:11
price action has been between that 62.5 and that 64.8 just under
3:17
65k so the question is what happens next how do we plan for this now essentially as I shared on the previous
3:24
week's stream one of the setups that I'm looking for is I talked about the fact that I'm not really really overly eager
3:31
to take any shorts just yet in the market however if I see a spike up into
3:38
that 65 66k region which is pushing up into here running some of the stops here
3:45
okay taking some of this liquidity and then pulls back back into
3:50
this shortterm range then I probably would take on a short opportunity looking for price
3:56
to trade back into 61 62k into the bid side okay not something that's going to
4:03
define the rest of my life a trading crate it is just a trade all right now
4:09
equally um these asks may get pulled I'll just have to see what the book does and what
4:15
I'm essentially looking for in this instance is priz to push up into this level open interest to spike up
4:23
okay and Longs piling in but unable to push price should that happen and price
4:28
finds acceptance back below low 65k again then I think I I may just take a stab at that we'll see okay but
4:34
ultimately my preferred scenario is if price does subsequently roll over from
4:40
this region here um at 65 64k into 61 60
4:46
59 wherever it's going to react okay we've got a key level of demand over
4:52
here okay so if price does subsequently trade back into this level okay break
4:57
this trend line trade back down into here that's going to be the area of interest I'm not sure where whether it's
5:03
61 or 62 point something or 60 or 59 but somewhere in there is where I'd like to
5:09
do my business okay so just looking at the books you can see that there's there's a fairly decent ask uh on the
5:16
ask side and there's there's a fairly decent bit of depth on the the bid side which is essentially what's compressing
5:21
price within this region [Music] okay let's move on to the charts now
5:28
moving on to the charts I've talked about where currently I'm looking at in terms of um order book depth okay it's
5:36
fairly similar on the other exchanges so we won't really cover too much on what we're seeing on the other exchanges but
5:43
essentially the key thing that I want to point out in this instance and what is
5:49
really important to me is the fact that Bitcoin is now trading above the 12 25
5:55
weekly EMAs okay what I would like to see is essentially price respect this
6:02
Zone respect this level okay I don't mind if price happens to at some point
6:09
over the coming days or weeks trades just below this as long as it can get back above that should be a good enough
6:16
long trigger in terms of the context where I would probably be slightly
6:21
reluctant to step into a long is if price starts trading back below the 1225
6:27
weekly EMA then I would suggest that there's a possibility or a probability but first
6:35
we need to see it happen is should price start trading below the level that we may get a deep deeper retracement back
6:40
into that 55 56k level I'm hopeful right hopeful that this is the level that
6:46
holds okay is that
6:53
clear and the key thing for me is contextually the the bands have never
6:58
really death crossed or crossed over so it's encouraging it it is encouraging as
7:04
far as I'm concerned and uh for that reason I've my my bias remains looking
7:09
for Longs being patient looking for Longs okay and and that's going to continue to be the
7:14
plan but I think what would be great is let's just assume that we don't see much
7:20
further volatility in the week that price is still contained within this region I think a weekly close above 61
7:27
62k even if it does happen happen to remain within this very
7:33
short average true range between 64.8 and 62.4 five you know that's
7:41
fairly promising that's pretty decent okay and that's a key thing for me it it's indecision not sure where the
7:50
market wants to go next looking for long setups equally you know we could see the market pop up high let's just take a
7:57
step back and talk about high time frame
8:02
when you look at this again I've made a point where is this really distribution
8:08
which many claim it to be a form of distribution I'm not convinced it is
8:13
okay I think this is more of a yes as I've covered on previous streams it's a
8:19
a case of lower highs and lower lows but it is still within this range B
8:24
environment of 55.5 and the highs of of 72k all right
8:31
so essentially we are respecting that yearly mid level if this is our yearly
8:36
low there's our yearly High We respect to the yearly mid level as long as price is contained above the yearly mid level
8:43
and and like I said adverse scenario should price start trading below the bands we're still not a far distance
8:50
away from the bands okay so there's still a possibility that again adverse scenario should we break down lower that
8:56
the bands will continue going sideways given an opportunity to get back into position from a long lower down from 56
9:03
from 57s okay uh and equally when once it gets back above I think that then gives you the certainty that one 2 3
9:10
four tests of the lower bounds but above the yearly mid level should be enough of a Confluence to say right it's time to
9:16
take it higher now the key thing in terms of context is I've used a range extension here does everybody understand
9:23
how I've mapped out this range extension looking for projections to the upside such that if this is a consol ating
9:30
pattern there's a flag pole there's a consolidation when we do get a breakout
9:35
I'd be looking for a one to1 extension contining higher so first objective would be the 80k level the second
9:42
objective would be 90k after that we'll see what happens but like I said to even
9:47
contemplate that we we really need to see a real significant volume and clearance above the 72k level to take us
9:55
to that 80k level all right
10:03
and the question you want to be asking is do you really want to be fading that okay we've had three
10:09
attempts of the high time frame mid level or what is the Range
10:14
High we've tested this level once closed back below and again and again a fourth
10:20
test of that level would be very very interesting and I'd have to go with the probability as I've explained on
10:26
previous examples that when you see price trade below the 1221 only to reclaim back above it consolidate that
10:33
often marks the continuation of a trend higher so we'll just have to wait and see and I think price is pretty much
10:38
playing out as I've anticipated I did say that I don't think we're we're
10:44
likely to take off anytime soon we could see a continuation of chop and range and
10:49
rotational plays um but what that does give if you look at the Timeline if you
10:54
look at the feed and it's really really brought about some um level of uh
11:00
optimism with altcoins we've seen altcoins perform well when bitcoin's volatility is
11:06
relatively contained altcoins are popping off we've seen memes pop off with Bonk u a couple of others popcat is
11:13
another one that comes to mind even you look at sui we've seen say move off the off the low so where alts are I think
11:20
that there's some really good opportunities setting up and I think you have to be fairly optimistic for as long as Bitcoin and and the rest of the
11:26
market in terms of um SBA and NASDAQ and some of the mag 7 are are continuing to
11:35
maintain their structure then uh I'm fairly optimistic for you know price over the coming weeks heading into Q4
11:41
into October but essentially what I want you to really think about is context
11:47
so you know you look at price and you think well if Bitcoin is going to trade Above This level and find acceptance
11:54
what does that mean for the broader Market what does that mean for altcoins okay now I can appreciate that many any
12:00
of you have some level of fear or your emotions have probably been smashed due
12:06
to price especially in altcoin is retracing 70 80% but forget what's happened in the
12:12
past look ahead of you look at the opportunity ahead and and try to think just one step ahead at a time that
12:18
should Bitcoin start trading Above This level find acceptance above there at some point whether it's a pullback first
12:23
and then continuation higher what does that mean for the broader Market what does that mean for altcoins heading into Q4 what does that mean with the fact
12:29
that we see an uptaking Global liquidity we see China cutting back on their rates and trying to stimulate their economy so
12:37
in terms of the narrative over the next few weeks you know things are looking fairly prospectively good but it may
12:42
just drag on a little longer all right the next um chart that I want to
12:48
focus on is again what sorry with the next indicator that I'd like to just quickly touch upon is the weekly stock
12:55
RSI so again the way I see this is if you followed my streams over the years I do not want to
13:01
be fading when momentum is likely to push or oscillate to theide okay so again looking for opportunity to the
13:07
upside
13:21
here now moving
13:27
forward let's start talking about trade
13:37
setups using the levels that we've got from the higher time frames we have a clearly
13:44
defined key pivotal level at 68 70k where price hasn't really found
13:51
acceptance above you can see we've had a Weck we Clos above it for one week traded back below another Weck another
13:57
Weck another Weck and so forth okay so in terms of a
14:03
range taking this swing High we'll mark this in
14:10
blue now we're purely talking about trade setup here and taking this key pivotal level round about the
14:17
yearly mid level into this demand Zone that's the range where I'm looking to
14:23
get back into a long so I traded 54 to 61 I took a trade from 62 to 64s okay
14:30
when you look at the Daily Now what is happening under the hoods okay in terms of price well you can see that price is
14:37
currently being capped by a level of resistance as I've shown you in the
14:42
order books okay 65 66 there's a bunch of a asks there and I think anybody
14:48
shorting this you'd have to be fairly frustrated because you've had one two three four five six seven days of price
14:55
action okay and equally I think anybody who's longing this from the lows of 54k and
15:03
now you've decided to long into resistance I just think there's far better setups far better setups than
15:10
than what we currently have in front of us so I think the Temptation has been
15:16
there for me to punt on a shot but like I said I I just don't really fancy taking it on and when you draw a keep
15:24
pivot level which I've identified on the chart earlier this week this is the area
15:29
we'll mark this in uh let's just say green for buying okay when you look at this in terms of inflection
15:38
points one okay
15:43
two 3 four right price traded below the
15:49
level got back above got back above rallied to where that 65k level
15:57
okay found resistance pull back into a 60k same again find support and again
16:06
okay resistance lost a level trades lower down back into resistance flips
16:12
back above it so for me this is a key pivotal Zone here is that
16:18
clear look at the number of touch points buyers have always been stepping in at this level in most cases now let's drop
16:25
into the 4our chart we've defined our Range High we've defined our range low we've defined our local resistance we've
16:31
defined this green line in terms of touch points and the level of Confluence it
16:38
offers now let's drop into the 4our chart and I think this is where it it starts to get interesting okay because
16:46
when you look at price from from this perspective is
16:54
that we've defined the range Highs at 74 okay we've
16:59
defined the range lows at 53k let's take the midle of that level
17:05
now and you can see the mid is hovering at around about 63 64k okay kind of
17:12
confluent with what we've got at 65 66 it's not too far off again it's at the middle I don't really want to be doing
17:17
business when it's chopping this in this nature or in this fashion so I think in terms of long
17:24
setups should price break below this structure I think
17:30
like I said there could be one more possibility where we see a squeeze taking out these highs taking out any
17:36
shorts that have opened up here okay and this High here and then we may get a
17:42
pullback that isn't unusual in Bitcoin where you get this compression into resistance price trades above the level
17:49
long start piling in they get absorbed by passive sellers okay and what do you see well first of all you're going to
17:55
rustle these shorts okay so they're going to get stopped out long side piling in if they're unable to push price higher and price finds acceptance
18:02
back below this key level then I think there's a possibility that we trade back into that 61 62k demands on here okay
18:09
that's the zone that I'd like to see hold that's the Zone where the 1225 uh weekly EMAs are possibly the 21s
18:17
as well this is where I'm looking for the trigger point okay so coming to this level show me your level of support give
18:23
me a swing uh swing point to establish a low or even just below this level here because we we know historically the
18:30
number of touch points this level has had that I'm going to assume it's fairly safe to place my stop just below that
18:36
level depending where the swing point is okay it could even stop short we we may not get a deep sell off into 60k it may
18:42
just stop short at 61 62k it may just run these lows here stop short guess
18:49
back above then what do you do that's the question you want to be asking yourself so you got two scenarios here
18:54
one is a deeper pullback into 59 60k confluent with the 1221 or 25 EMAs the
19:02
second scenario is run these lows just below 62k where we've also seen on the books in terms of trading light the bids
19:08
are fairly stacked there as long as those bids are there and they're passive and
19:13
sells aggresses are hitting into those passive bids and they're being filled okay then that would give me a level of
19:20
encouragement that maybe this might be the opportunity look for price to take out these lows to get back inside that
19:26
we can push up higher into that 697 K level okay that's what I'm thinking is that
19:33
clear now the question is what happens if we don't Spike the highs we don't run
19:39
the highs we don't run the stops we don't print a higher high again it doesn't really change what what change
19:45
much for me whether the fact that we do print a higher high or not I'm still looking for if price does break down
19:50
here over the coming days or whenever again this is a key level then I think increases the probability that look
19:57
trade below here I think we possibly come to 61 6 62k hold the level I'm
20:02
looking for long straight back above up into 65 66 67 all right now the third
20:09
scenario which is my least favorite um and I may be tempted to start taking
20:14
some profits on some of my ALT exposure is such
20:19
that looking at Price here we're getting this compression into that 65k level
20:25
should price close above it shallow pullback and then continue higher when you look at the extension of the move
20:31
from 53 to 70k I think that's a fairly significant move into these Highs at
20:37
that point I probably will be taking profit on some of my ALT exposures especially in my Futures account and
20:42
then at that point I'd have to be looking for a pull back into that 65k level to see if that holds okay that's
20:48
what I'm thinking back into the mid level essentially is what I'm looking to see all right so they're kind of the
20:54
three scenarios the three trading scenarios I'm not looking to long into resistance here I just don't it doesn't
21:00
warrant it I'm still maintaining my spot exposure I'm still maintaining my spot
21:06
positioning on altcoins but in terms of Futures trades in terms of intraday
21:11
trades or trades that I'm looking for on altcoins I will be looking to take profit on some some players like say
21:17
which I've got both a Futures position and a spot position running but that's
21:23
what I have to work with I'm not sure what much else there is to add to this doesn't have to be complicated or more
21:30
complicated than it is and uh there're the three scenarios so as a Trader I couldn't tell you
21:35
what's going to happen next all I can tell you is should price come to the levels that I've mapped out then I'm
21:41
looking for a trigger point and I will react and I will look to take on the
21:46
trade okay what if the 61 62k level doesn't
21:51
hold are you shorting no I'm not going to be shorting because like I said look I can understand why Others May
21:59
short right but at the end of the day I I've explained my context my context is based upon the higher time
22:06
frame um and yeah look if people believe price is going to go higher then then fair enough you
22:12
know they're entitled to to their opinions the way that I'm looking at price is that this is just a range one
22:19
environment I'd much rather be a buyer for as long as the yearly mid level holds okay we're still we're still
22:25
contained in an uptrend we're still Trading uh in terms of um structure you
22:31
know buyers have been stepping into this 50 54 55k level we we've not spent much
22:37
time at these lows so I'm looking for long opportunities
22:42
whether it's a pullback into continuation higher
22:53
okay I'm sorry I'm just reading through the chat trying to see what some of the comments saw if this's
22:59
any valid
23:06
questions but everything I do is based off the high time frame context and if you really want to keep
23:12
it simple okay if you really want to keep it
23:17
simple clear your chart okay if you want to trade this I'm not talking about
23:23
investment purely from a trading perspective okay there's your range highs
23:32
and you want to Mark out your range lows this is just another way to do it this this was the key demand Zone where price
23:37
Consolidated and printed new all-time highs this is that consolidation where price is now respecting that level okay
23:44
you can see that there's the range lows there's the range highs Mark out the mid doesn't take much one minute or so
23:52
to pretty much map out the charts okay and where where are we we're pretty much
23:57
at the mid level okay so it's it's it's a bit dicey around this level and like I said there's a there's a level of um
24:04
resistance at 65k which I guess we'll test a lot of people's patience to get into a long
24:11
position or people are overly eager looking to short This and like I said when when you when you zoom out and look at this from a daily perspective you
24:18
know um should we tap that liquidity above the previous swing High to the
24:26
left then and we get back below this mid level of 63k we'll probably run these highs and
24:32
we'll probably trade somewhere into this region here which is round about the range quarter so mid-range range high
24:39
range low run these highs if it fails to hold this level um and it doesn't
24:44
continue on higher which is the the the pullback scenario that I've suggested if it does break back inside then I think
24:50
we at least take out these lows if not then potentially down to 59 60k whether
24:55
whether 12 21 12 25 are into that quarterly range level look for a
25:02
reaction go long again look for higher prices okay that that will be your shift in terms
25:07
of lower high lower high lower low a higher low okay into a higher high into
25:16
a higher low higher low in context of the previous Wing
25:24
Point and that's all there is to it really okay let's move on to Total
25:30
three oh let's look at total two I should say in terms of alt coins this was the scenario that I had
25:37
uh from many weeks ago I thought we probably would get one pullback I think I posted this back in I I think it was
25:45
mid August one more pull back into the lows and I want to see price push out of
25:50
this to trade higher again there's still a lot of work to be done here in my opinion uh but I I am looking for that
25:57
continuation pattern for for as long as look it's very simple for me for as long as price holds this level here okay this
26:04
was a previous range sideways price action for for the best part of one and
26:09
a half years we finally broke above it we've retested that level and if you look at ALS across the board that
26:15
retraced 70 80 90% they they really have provided some excellent buying opportunities to at
26:21
least at least take on risk short term okay so I don't I don't really see anything significantly bearish about
26:27
altcoins at this current juncture but like I said uh you know I am looking to
26:32
be aggressive and look for buying opportunities on altcoins and that will continue to be the case for as long as
26:39
this structure is maintained I think if we start trading below this level for
26:45
whatever reason then then yeah there's a there's a big question mark on the uh continuation of altcoins rallying into
26:52
Q4 let's move on to Total three
26:59
again when you look at this structure of
27:08
price using this key swing low and this as a key swing
27:14
high or whether you want to use this one over here it's entirely optional okay look at where price is
27:20
again we we kind of tapped that key demand Zone here we're holding above that level we're trading back in this
27:26
range we're starting to push above the trend line here let's go into the 3-day
27:31
chart okay that to me is not a bearish structure for now okay that to me is a
27:40
corrective structure a consolidation structure of multi months the fact that
27:45
we've had one two three tests very similar to bitcoin and we're unable to break this low okay that's ideal buying
27:53
opportunities at these lows okay as long as price is holding structure here
27:58
now let me just bring back the trend scanner to give some context into
28:04
this when you look at the weekly we have what have we done here
28:10
okay somebody tell me in the chat What's Happening Here what are you
28:20
seeing the 12 and the 21 death crossed sorry the taller than
28:26
25 death crossed price is now trading above the bands
28:32
okay what's important for me which will give me the trigger
28:38
is we've had the bare signal here but the minute this turns bullish it's not often that you get two signals that goes
28:45
from bear to Bull back to bear and sells off you generally get one signal and
28:51
then very quickly another signal which is generally the trend or the strength of the market Direction I'll show you an
28:57
example that on the lower time frames but here's a classic example look in a bare Market this flashed bullish few
29:05
weeks later back to bearish and continuation lower lower down okay so what I'm looking for is again price to
29:13
hold this 1225 level and should it do that and should price pull back into
29:18
here if Bitcoin does trade that 61k level or 62 you probably get a shallow
29:24
pullback on altcoins and what you want to be focusing upon is altcoins that you believe look structurally good altcoins
29:30
that have shown a level of strength you're looking for those pullbacks to continue playing the M momentum up and
29:35
also cycle into those altcoins that look primed that eventually they will also have a run and there's so many examples
29:41
out there that I probably won't get to cover it in stay stream because I want to keep this relatively short I just want to give you the high time frame
29:48
context to think about to give you the confidence to take on some trades take on some positioning as long as the
29:54
preconditions that I'm talking about hold and I'm it and that is I want to
29:59
see price hold this level okay on a weekly time
30:06
frame now let's look at the daily and again this is just another
30:12
example that I want to uh go over with you guys um in terms of when I talk
30:18
about signals okay weaknesses or strength I haven't really covered this
30:24
in the past but when you have have
30:30
structures that are bearish okay where prices swing fail the highs you've had
30:37
an undd retest you can see you got the bull signal but look how shortlived the candles were in terms of
30:43
green before they flipped to red and you saw that continuation of a selloff okay
30:49
again look at the time duration of how shortlived price was in a bullish
30:54
momentum compared to the overall Trend red you just get these pockets of green
31:00
in a downtrend okay same again continuation low down another pocket of
31:08
green followed by downtrend okay what you want to see is essentially
31:19
where this is a classic example here okay watch what gives you strength in
31:25
the signal when when it's quite noisy out there is you will get this low level compression price gives you a bull
31:31
signal a bare signal very quickly turns bull there's your bull market there's your there's your bull run okay or an
31:38
extension to the upside now look at the time duration of the period that we were
31:45
in the red we were green flip red very quickly for a flip green continuation
31:50
highight you're going to see this on a lot of altcoins right now where we are pay close attention to this that's the
31:57
flip in momentum that you want to see on altcoins whether it's on the daily on the 3day and eventually probably not so
32:04
much on the weekly but on the 3day certainly right now now looking at this
32:10
we've had this extended leg up in the market period of red shorter period of
32:18
green price sells off okay you can see sellers are in control of the market
32:23
longer extended periods of Reds than greens okay now red a pop off green
32:29
pulls back into red now we're getting an extension probably the first time over
32:35
the best part of a few months that we are seeing some form of continuation up but what's important here is the fact
32:42
that this is on the daily but if you look at the weekly the weekly flip bearish here if
32:49
this is bullish I want to see these bands cross back up and this signal a bu condition any pullback you've got to go
32:56
with the trends you have you have to go with a trend until you lose that level
33:01
okay think about that I don't talk about that very often but think about what the
33:07
signals are actually telling you the choppiness the flipping of ball to Bear
33:12
ball to bear bear to ball back and forth okay on the lower time frames but then looking at the high time
33:18
frame context right when you look at Price look at the look at the period of
33:25
red that we've had in terms of the the the 1225 I keep calling it 1221 it's a
33:31
1225 very very shortlived and it could potentially flip green again so
33:37
corrective pattern if this gets continuation higher then you really want to thought
33:42
start thinking about positioning into altcoins okay and you haven't missed out much it's still very very
33:48
early okay is that clear
33:59
now I just want to give you one final Food For Thought which is price
34:04
structure I want you to think about price structure now when you look at ethereum I want to
34:11
ask a question to the audience and this is probably the last chart I'm going to focus on we will have another session
34:16
over the weekend uh where I think setups will become evidently clearer when you look at this structure
34:26
here tell me tell me what you're thinking in the chat I'd like to see some comments please look we're in this
34:31
range okay but what do you think of this current structure here does this look
34:38
ready to go higher on the weekly time
34:44
frame or are we likely to see further consolidation for the next several weeks at this region what are you
34:55
thinking needs more time retest the laws potentially yeah could
35:02
do may not right but would you say given the
35:08
current conditions that you are in looking at the market sentiment looking at the macro
35:14
sentiment looking at this revived stimulation of
35:19
liquidity picking up heading into
35:25
Q4 are we likely to just sell from here bounce and then continue lower
35:30
down or is this the first significant correction that we've had since we broke
35:36
out of this one and a half year range we rallied we've come back to retest the previous range
35:44
consolidation okay so I'm trying to be objective here and I don't see the purpose in being bearish I was oh I
35:50
don't like to use the word bearish okay but I was very very cautious back in April I I talked about this on the
35:55
timeline back in March April uh I remember cashing G of ethereum at 3600 I opened some shorts okay we caught the
36:02
long move up okay when we got that massive two three day candle in ethereum
36:07
which kind of ripped high okay but like I said it was just at these range highs into that Supply Zone here look at this
36:13
there's your Range High so we are still contained within the range but what I really want you to
36:20
think about if you're if you have fear of missing out and you think you've missed the altcoin bottom is that there
36:26
still so much UPS left ahead of you okay just calm down Don't Panic it's good
36:32
okay structural shifts take time it's like a slow turning tide this isn't in my opinion for now
36:40
okay and I could be wrong I don't think this is going to be reverse all the way back
36:45
up and I think there's a possibility again I'm looking to be a buyer not so much of ethereum but I use ethereum as a
36:52
proxy to think about altcoins that we might just see one more pull back into this level
36:58
that may give you a bigger base from which price pushes on back to the range highs
37:05
okay I'm open to this possibility I'm not saying it's going to happen but if this does happen I think you're going to
37:10
see a level of fear oh no like ethereum's breaking down bitcoin's trading lower down [ __ ] you know I I I
37:16
think you've got to go with the with a possibility that this could present a very good buying opportunity as long as
37:22
these lows hold okay you've got to take that risk the risk reward is so good there because you have a a very clear validation level unless something
37:28
changes geopolitically or or macro wise okay now what I would you to really think about as well
37:36
is can you see a similar structure on the chart anywhere else if you look back in time look at what happened here where
37:43
was the highs it was at $4,000 $4,000 $4,000 okay price sells off
37:51
significantly sells off significantly okay didn't [ __ ] about straight to that level rallied up to where 20 700s
37:58
rallied up to where if you just drag this across the line whoops into that similar Zone and what
38:04
did price then do printed another low you have three Taps here we've already
38:10
had one push down two okay price then gives a shallow rally is this
38:16
another lower high into an equal set of lows is this another lower high into an
38:21
equal set of lows and then you get the pushup okay so that could be on the cards I think should that happen I will
38:27
be looking to become a buyer but we'll see what happens closer to the time so again just that's what I want you to
38:33
think about is price is context the very first thing I said before I started looking at the ethereum chart look at
38:39
the context look at the structures forget everything else forget the levels just look at the possible structures
38:44
that may play out understand what price might be doing and what it needs to do to turn around what you need to see okay
38:51
now when you bring in the macro Trend scanner ethereum does look suspect in
38:58
comparison to Total two and total three on the other RS it has it has been in inherently
39:04
weaker than the other
39:10
altcoins so now when you drop onto the 3day chart we we we've just reverted back
39:16
into the band that's your resistance there okay we are still in a period of red this is not an uptrend just yet for
39:24
me this is a correction the formation of a base which key word right keyw here
39:32
may just give a pullback I don't know where to it may come down to retest the lows again ideally I wouldn't want to
39:39
see that because if that does happen that obviously mean Bitcoin has to trade significantly lower below the 61 60k
39:45
level so if Bitcoin trades 60 61k then where does ethereum pull back
39:50
into 2400 23s 22s okay and then gives a reversal
39:57
okay that's that's what I'm thinking in this instance you have this consolidation of
40:03
a structure price trends up consolidation price rallies aggressive selloff
40:11
bounces back into the lows shallow bounce into the bands back again compression of the Bands there's your
40:18
bll signal price goes back to the highs are we going to see something similar compression of the Bands price pulls
40:25
back then you get the break up higher into four ,000 okay yeah if BTC looks questionable
40:32
still I mean it's still in a downtrend but does that make sense do you understand what I mean now by structure and context before you look at anything
40:39
else okay think about how it takes time for the tie to turn especially after
40:45
selloff when you look at the daily we've just flipped bullish okay
40:51
now like I said if and it's a big question if if this is short lived and
40:57
it flips back into a bare signal then that opens the probability that we're going to trade somewhere back into this
41:04
region and if that happens you're probably going to get get that pullback on altcoins over the coming weeks okay
41:10
if that happens if Bitcoin just gives a shallow pullback then you might just get 2450 before you start seeing
41:16
continuation up to 2000 if we get below the Bands then you've got to be at you've got to be targeting these lows
41:23
here may not print a new low but you've got to be looking for this Zone here to to be thinking about buying into
41:28
altcoins and potentially if you wish to position into ethereum a position into ethereum looking for that bounce back up
41:35
okay that if sellers can't force this lower down and they get absorbed then I
41:40
think there's a good chance of reversal back up at least into that 3200 level that to me is going to be a fantastic
41:46
trading setup all right and when you look at the
41:52
stock on the uh on the weekly again do you really want be short in this
41:59
market I'm not so sure okay I'd much rather be looking for longs to the
42:04
upside okay let let this play out to be a corrective structure a structure that's going to take time to build a
42:11
base I don't think it's going to be a v v reversal because we haven't really
42:17
had any significant continuation that we should have if this was the uh the effects of the yend carrier trade and
42:24
this was an event driven selloff then I don't think we would have been [ __ ] around here for this many weeks so you
42:30
know again looking to become a buyer don't want to fade this oscillating at the lows possibly if you look at the RSI
42:37
it's probably hovering under the 50 or at the 50 level yeah so again once this
42:43
starts Crossing above 50 you want to go with the strength you don't want to be fading this and looking for shorts into
42:49
here okay day trade fine if you want to do that I'm talking more about high time frame just give me one second guys
43:24
okay any questions around that I'm not going to cover all I think I've been on stream for 40 40 nearly 50 minutes so
43:31
you should kind of get the gist
43:37
okay but understand what price is telling you understand what positioning is telling you understand what
43:43
structures you need to see develop go back and test how many times you see structures like this just V
43:49
reverse from this point you've got to see a bigger kind of a base building and I think then you see continue for for
43:55
there a chance to be a real good continuation High let's look at some altcoins I'm just going to look at one two altcoins say is one of my favorites
44:02
I've covered it on the timeline several times and again when you look at this this is a much better better example of
44:09
strength in the market right where you've had this downtrend into demand one two 3 four
44:16
five tests I think I covered this did I cover this on stream last week but beautiful very very very happy with this
44:23
trade okay stepped in at 27 28s I'm holding my spot I've taken some off my Futures position captured a fairly
44:30
decent move on Futures account okay now we are into that level of contention here and like I said Say Say often lag
44:38
so okay but again Cas study you you don't have to be a genius in this market
44:43
you just got into some structures and again when you just use the example of the Bands here
44:51
um look at this classic example of what I just talked about this is what you want to see
44:57
on alt coins okay question number one what is the
45:03
trajectory of velocity of the Bands telling you okay are they going is this going sideways or is it going
45:14
down and look at the velocity and the trajectory of Price look at this on the
45:19
way up do you want to be fading this
45:24
momentum not really
45:29
okay and then step number two is when you look at
45:37
Price across the board and you see this type of structure how the [ __ ] is this
45:45
bullish you spent half your try trying to short [ __ ] like this you finally give up you switch
45:54
long into distribution when price is starting to go side ways as indicated by the bands and now you're trying to
46:00
[ __ ] long the market you're looking for a price to go to three four5 at this point the fact that you've now
46:07
essentially got a range here and you've got another swing High over
46:12
here okay if this was bullish this level should have held swing fill this Clos back inside trade support unide retest
46:21
but what remember what I told you earlier bear flips into bull very very quickly continuation higher this is
46:27
bearish flips into bullish but look at that very very short period of being
46:33
bullish flips back to being bearish that's where you know structurally this is this this is a course of concern and
46:40
we're likely to trade into lower down and the rest is history right but what I want you to think about forget that now
46:45
that that's probably a future lesson for thinking about how to take profits we'll come back to that later if we get a a
46:51
fairly extensive rally in altcoins now look at this price has come down okay on let let's go back to the uh
46:58
3-day chart or in fact we'll say on The Daily Find supports okay you need to see
47:05
a range develop this is your swing low this is your swing high this is going to
47:11
be your defined probable range as long as it slow holds let's run It
47:17
Forward look at the trajectory of the Bands here and then watch the trajectory of the Bands
47:23
here see that slow down in Pace look at the angle of elevation and look at the
47:28
angle of elevation now watch price cross over and under the over and under the bands okay you got a bare signal there
47:36
into the lows look at this lack of selling look at the lack of volume okay
47:42
price is down significantly from the highs of 115 into 26 and the reason I'm
47:47
covering this because you will see the same structure on altcoins that are lagging that have yet to run okay you
47:55
should be able to Define very good set up some projects that are fundamentally sound or meme
48:00
coins what I'm looking for here is there there's many ways you can map this out first of all you've
48:07
got a possible trend line break okay you want to see a breaking trend line whether it's this point or whether it's
48:13
somewhere from up here okay second point is let me just clean
48:19
up the chart sorry just give me one second there's your consolidation Zone
48:26
okay we this is a downtrend okay we're
48:31
starting to develop a form of a range here we've got a bu uh we've got a bull
48:36
cross okay back into a bear into this key demand Zone price is
48:42
retrace all this inefficiency here what I'm looking for now at this point is that one we're we're at the
48:50
range lows okay this is my swing low
48:57
this is my key swing Range High over here that's the range I'm working with I
49:03
want to see sideways price action to continue or to think about building a position
49:09
here bull bear bull see that that three toggle switch whatever
49:15
you want to call it I don't know what the [ __ ] to call it but went from bullish quickly into bearish back into bullish expansion to the
49:22
upside that's what you want to be looking out for on altcoins okay go to the 3day what do we have the bands are
49:29
starting to compress look at that curvature we're still not
49:35
out of this range at this present point in time this is on the 21st of
49:42
September but you want to start seeing the expansion and shift in structure have we broken structure yet have we
49:48
created a higher high we've got a higher low at this point doesn't mean [ __ ] because we haven't got a higher high
49:54
just [ __ ] now we've got our high high okay so again when you look at this from this
50:00
point of view we've pushed above the bands okay we're into this first significant level of Sr you go to the 3-day chart now look at
50:09
the band's developing the momentum is Shifting here you really want to be thinking about pullbacks and remember
50:15
what I said that when sellers are exhausted and the books
50:20
are very very thin it's not going to take a great deal of volume to push price higher and you want to be latching
50:27
on to any pullbacks now with a bit of an aggression you've got your invalidation
50:32
now at these lows here should price pull back into 3233 and holds and pushes on I'm looking
50:39
to continue longing this on my Futures account whilst I'm maintain my spot position
50:47
okay Trader XO you miss a macro bottom in
50:52
20122 yeah but I also short to the top into the bottom but like I said it doesn't really matter I'm I'm going to
51:00
I'm not going to get every top and bottom I think people obsess with tops and bottoms too much and um I made it
51:06
very very clear to answer your question look I think it's a good point and it doesn't bother me it doesn't piss me off
51:12
I just wish people would actually understand um that you need to lose this Fascination about nailing the absolute
51:19
bottom or I was bearish at the bottom let's put some records straight first of all I was short from here okay I tra all
51:26
the way down into this level 18K I called it a day I did not not know I didn't know that FTX was going to
51:32
implode right so obviously I'm cautious now you tell me right that again I'll
51:38
give you two examples here this is what two one from June 2022 through to
51:44
October uh 2023 I've traded this range several times Longs and shorts okay into the mid
51:52
shorts into the mid I didn't short at the mid clearly look at my
51:58
streams people find it hard to understand but had I bought spot out right here versus trading price okay
52:06
took some Longs took some shorts my net gain was Far significant trading this range than had I traded
52:13
just spot price okay that's my point and the same is very applicable here okay I've had very little spot explosure
52:20
during these last several months yet I've openly shared my thoughts all the way from January with uh uh Trader
52:28
orders and flow we we longed this we talked about this shared the setup longed into new highs long this long
52:35
this and this and then 54 last week or the week before every time has given a 10K bounce this was from 40K to 50 60
52:44
70k so my net gain from just purely trading has outperformed me whether I
52:49
bought Bitcoin and just held it all the way up and that's me that's personally Just My Style of trading you have to
52:55
understand that this isn't for everybody this is just my way of being comfortable
53:01
trading Bitcoin if I'm if if if I can't outperform Bitcoin on the way up then I
53:07
should stop trading full stop okay but I back myself as a Trader to outperform bitcoin on the way up versus just
53:13
holding spot all the way from trying to nail the bottom okay how many times did
53:19
you see people call long long bottoms in Bottoms in 30k Bottoms in no keeps going
53:25
lower why do you think funds and accounts blew up Traders lost a [ __ ] ton of money yeah I'm the only I'm one of
53:31
the few [ __ ] who who's actually making money on the way down then I get a lot of [ __ ] XO you miss the bottom
53:37
well not really because there's trading opportunities all all throughout the market and it's the same Concepts here
53:42
for the last six months right what's price done it's done nothing but range bound price action if
53:48
you've held spot over the last six months chances are probably made way more money than anybody in terms of
53:54
relativeness or even myself had I just bought spot and held it here what's my gain if I if I bought even from 53 or 40
54:01
42 to 63k 20K big deal but in between there there's there's a 10K bounce
54:08
there's another bounce there's another bounce there's a shorting opportunity there's a lot more money to be made in range than holding so it's that that's
54:15
that's my point okay so you can win J all you want if you if you're that good why don't you step up and uh get your
54:21
awesome stream and uh stream for other people to take your views and opinions all right end of story I'm not having a
54:29
go at you I'm just telling the facts it's nobody's going to nail the tops and the bottoms I'm not going to do it all
54:34
the time either and that's just the nature of trading you have to accept that whether you like it or
54:43
not but I just want to point out that there are times when you can actually be very very profitable from Trading okay
54:49
that's the point of what I try to explain when it's range the range is there to be milked one of my strengths
54:55
is trying range when price is trending I take less trades just let price do what it what it wants
55:04
okay so again I'm going to go over another example in terms of um altcoins
55:10
here and Wormhole look is another example
55:16
again when you look at the trend scanner
55:27
okay if you look at the longevity of the bands in terms of the direction and the trend the period of red we had one flash
55:34
of bull and it turns back into selling now what I'm looking for here
55:40
essentially I think this is a really good opportunity this is another one that I've positioned into off the September monthly
55:47
open and such that if Bitcoin does give that pullback then I I I am looking to
55:52
just keep chipping away into a position if we lose the level I'll just say back wait for it to flip again so I don't
55:58
know whether the lows are in they could very well be but as far as I'm concerned this is the range where I'm looking to
56:04
build a position okay because we've been here now for two months August and almost at the end of September if it
56:10
push on higher fine I've got some exposure I'll wait for the next pullback if we break down below the bands I'll
56:15
just wait for it to flip and go back into position looking for price to kind of give the the the uh acceleration to
56:22
the upside okay so that's that's just another example there that you can look at again when you look at the 3-day chart
56:27
it's just into those bands what I'm looking for to see momentum keyword strength and momentum is the bounds
56:35
compressing price trading above it then you're going to see that acceleration to the upside okay and finally let's look
56:40
at Su as an example of What's Happen and the momentum it's played
56:46
out when you look at the daily okay so again in this instance where you've
56:53
got price coming into a level of
57:02
support okay period of red first sign of strength in the market we get a segment
57:08
of green Flip's bearish but but again now look at this look how short lift it is flips back above let's just circle
57:16
this area here this is where the key transition was now I go to the
57:22
3day where did the 3day compress and cross right in that spot where did it flip bullish there there's your shift of
57:28
momentum to the upside that's how you identify momentum
57:34
early yeah but you could say I I understand your comment about projects like wormal with [ __ ] up tokenomics
57:41
prevents you from buying them you're not buying them for the long term if the market is going to go up it's going to go up regardless of the supply I thought
57:48
that about salano when salano with $3 in 2020 or 2019 that there's a shitload of
57:53
Sal coming onto the market how is this ever going to go up look what salana did went to $200 from three ended up chasing
58:01
it from $20 to 200 so I think you've just got to be objective and look at
58:08
price and strength forget you can the best time to look at tokenomics is when you're in a bare Market because that is
58:13
going to add significant sell pressure but you think about it if you're an investor and you're in Wormhole right
58:20
and you've got your tokens are you really going to capitulate at these lows after what's been in a significant sell if anybody has puked has puked
58:26
think about sentiment think about participants think about market look at the small bodied candles what are they telling you here that sellers are
58:33
exhausted the books are very thin to the upside once the momentum ignites price is going to pick up pace you're looking
58:40
for that crossover to to flow with momentum so that's why I I really really like the the opportunities are that are
58:47
ahead of us okay and one sentiment one sentiment picks up trust me you look at sui
58:54
right as an example
59:01
um no that's that's a stock look at people trying to chase
59:06
this now all of a sudden from here and here and here people want to chase momentum people start fear of missing
59:12
out byas start piling in and and then and then where people really screw
59:17
up is again when you look at this right why
59:23
in your right mind after what has been a six month sell off why in your right mind are you trying to short this people
59:29
are trying to short this over here then here then here all prices come into resistance here um this has probably got
59:36
to give it this is going to be a good shorting opportunity there's not there's not even being a pullback and price just rips
59:41
through what happens is people start piling into shorts shorts pay to open their positions they get puked caught
59:48
offside they puke price goes higher so not only do you have spot buyers and per
59:53
Longs piling it to momentum you've got shorts trying to Pile in in an
59:58
uptrend and if you just stick to a simple set of moving averages and a simple set of rules right why in your
1:00:05
right mind would you want to be shorting when look at the trajectory of the Bands okay so this is
1:00:12
what I want you to think about if we do get an extensive rally into Q4 right you
1:00:18
you've got a very simple system to follow here and I'm giving you that system on this streame when you've got
1:00:25
the B pushing up in this trajectory why are you trying to fade this what you
1:00:30
will see at some point okay is this look at the trajectory then when
1:00:38
price tails off now look at the trajectory of the Bands is this still going up or is this
1:00:44
going sideways now you have a defined range there's your swing High you've got
1:00:49
a swing point out somewhere along these lines okay let me just Mark that out again you've got a swing High to work
1:00:56
with first significant swing okay where did it come into the into this low here
1:01:02
okay another swing High takes out the previous high but look at the bands there's your signal and shifting
1:01:10
context now you want to be thinking about taking profit if it gets back under because you've had a failed
1:01:16
attempt and it's likely to go back into the mid and if you can't hold the mid Underside retest it's likely to go to
1:01:21
the range lows and if that doesn't hold there's you're breaking structure now what you're going to do you're going to
1:01:27
puke it down here or you're going to start longing the market all the way down because you can't shift your context when you already forewarned that
1:01:35
momentum is slowing down price is going in a Range the bullish case
1:01:41
scenario right let's just take it a step back the bullish case here would have
1:01:47
been in this situation what have I covered with you today if if this was a weekly band you
1:01:55
want to see price get look look at this is compressing under the bands it will eventually pop to the upside what you
1:02:02
want to see if this is a range that's been defined is consolidation accumul reaccumulation then continuation higher
1:02:09
what you don't want to see is price do something like this run the highs come
1:02:15
back inside I would I would absolutely be looking to get out of the market at that point because I know I can set back
1:02:21
in if we get continuation above here it's going to come back into the mid then your range now what are you going
1:02:27
to do when price gets back under the bands again that's an second signal now
1:02:32
to get out of the market let's run it forward and this is how you can recognize the differences subal
1:02:38
differences between accum reaccumulation and distribution reaccumulation you want to see price just stay within this range
1:02:45
for a longer period of time and eventually will crack up but when you see price make these sharp moves up gets
1:02:53
back inside and it can't even hold this and it it trades back to the mid and that cut hold and back to the lows then
1:02:59
you hope this holds because if that doesn't hold there's your breaking structure you're probably going to get something like a trap back inside the
1:03:04
range and sell back out again okay now if you run this forward let's see how this plays
1:03:10
out we've got it back above the bands back to the highs that would have been your case to get out sorry I've let
1:03:16
it go too fast Underside re retest of the mid sells off didn't even establish a phase of
1:03:24
reaccumulation so these are the subtleties that you want to start looking for again when I
1:03:30
clear all the all the crap off the charts if this was bullish why have we lost the bands here
1:03:37
and this is before it even breaks the lows right there's your range lows there's your mid-range there's your
1:03:42
range highs there's the swing fail deviation on high volume look at the weeks three weeks at the
1:03:48
highs gets back into the mid the bands are rolling over you want to get
1:03:53
out you don't even want to be all right You' don't have to short the market you just want to take some profit because
1:03:59
you want to think I might be able to buy the range lows or I might be able to buy a deviation if it gets back inside and
1:04:04
hold and if it if it can't hold and it fills out well guess what you're protecting your draw down and this is
1:04:09
where people [ __ ] up this is where people screw up because they don't know how when or how to get
1:04:15
out of the market after a rally and I'm trying to fall and warn you of that if we do get an exensive altcoin rallying
1:04:20
in Q4 these are the signs that you want to be thinking about to get out the market not people telling you it's a
1:04:26
bull market why the [ __ ] are you shorting why you taking profit you should be looking for even higher prices look at what the chart is telling you
1:04:33
all right look Underside retest as clean as you like price SS off so again when you
1:04:42
think of that there's there's no reason to be shorting this it's a reversion back into the bands continuation higher
1:04:47
until you get trajectory going sideways okay then you can start thinking about maybe it's time to take profit but you
1:04:54
don't want to be shorting on the left hand side of distribution
1:05:00
you want to wait for the tail side of distribution with weakness by the bands to get out of the market and that's all there is to it
1:05:06
okay so again simple simple tool simple strategy yet people still will continue
1:05:12
shorting alts on the way up over the coming weeks uh and unfortunately that's just that's just the market for you it
1:05:19
is what it is just don't be that individual who's trying to fade this it's not worth it if you want to sell
1:05:25
something like this you want to see I don't know distribution pattern breakdown price loses the bands there's
1:05:31
your trigger to go short now you can think about trading it all the way back down into support okay that's all the is
1:05:37
to
1:05:42
it so there's so many charts out there that that are looking really good tensor is another one um I know they've got
1:05:49
some Hefty Supply locks it's it's building a base we're not in that momentum phase yet okay what's what's
1:05:56
another chart I think then you've got coins like whiff which I think are great for trading um it's certainly showing some
1:06:02
momentum out of this consolidation pattern since June July August September
1:06:07
so again you know we've we've just pushed out of this range here okay what
1:06:14
I would like to see if Bitcoin pulls back and ethereum pulls back you may just get a retest off this level here a
1:06:21
higher low look you can map out TR line there
1:06:26
higher high higher high higher high higher low higher low higher low you want to see this hold as a higher low
1:06:32
into this range low uh range low that to me would be a very very good setup somewhere in there uh and I would
1:06:40
be looking for this level $263 and above there well you're in
1:06:46
Trend territory at that point you've got to go back for all-time highs okay so there's two ways you can trade this long
1:06:51
from a pullback going to the highs taking some parti along the way maybe take some profit pull back back above
1:06:59
Trend continuation to this high this high this High there's your range okay that's where you want to be doing your
1:07:07
business same with vanry there's nothing really much to say I think vanry looks fine for now it's building or what I
1:07:15
hope is building a base you know it's still the early days we're still maybe range Bound for a period of time this
1:07:22
might just do this over the coming weeks then we get the push-up or it might just give a shallow pull back and take off I don't know I don't
1:07:28
know I couldn't tell you I really couldn't tell you same with Jupiter Jupiter looks good um but again look
1:07:36
we're just into those into that level of resistance maybe we just get one more push lower down okay into here and then
1:07:42
we get the breakout at least targeting these highs then you got the range highs there's your mid there's your range lows
1:07:47
okay so very very good risk reward setups two r four r five R sixr whatever
1:07:52
you want to call it but some very good setups here that's going to give you four or that's going to give you 8 n r you're looking
1:08:00
to buy these lows here or you can wait you're either going to get price pull back into a high low or you're going to
1:08:06
get get a run of lows step back inside there's your second attempt at the trade now you're looking to trade the mid and
1:08:11
then the high this gives you greater possibility probability that this is ready to go to the mid level you might
1:08:16
just get a shallow pull back you just got to have some balls about you step inside and look look to trade it to the mid with a clear invalidation at the
1:08:23
lows um GTO is another one that I think looks fairly decent for a trade setup again you can think of this as a
1:08:32
double bottom okay one two three pull back into this level I'd be looking for Longs think of structure look think of
1:08:41
structure anybody think kind of know what this is what is the structure here that I'm
1:08:52
drawing what do we call this structure there's a name for
1:08:58
it it has to hold of
1:09:03
course yeah Adam and Eve okay so again do we get another pullback do these lws
1:09:09
hold if they do that that's that's a good opportunity for risk taking on the trade all
1:09:16
right um that's it that's it for me folks I I think that's enough streaming for me I didn't want to spend too long
1:09:22
but I've I've only gone on out done myself and spent an hour and 15 on the stream but I enjoy I enjoy teaching you
1:09:30
know I I don't claim to be the best trade in the world I just know what works well for me and hopefully the
1:09:36
knowledge that I pass on on these streams um will serve you well for
1:09:42
Q4 and uh I really like the opportunities that that are ahead of us and if it all goes tits up then so be it
1:09:49
we just have to manage our risk but I'm going to remain optimistic heading into Q4 I really like some of the structures
1:09:55
some of the setups um yeah I I think there's a good chance
1:10:01
we we see continuation or I'm hoping we see continuation I don't know I only know as
1:10:06
much as you guys I don't have a crystal ball I just go off the structure what price is telling me what sentiment is telling me positional macroeconomic
1:10:13
factors liquidity and invalidations and as long as you know we we maintain Bitcoin
1:10:20
holding 58 60k ethereum holding 2,000
1:10:26
maybe we'll get some pullbacks on altcoins then we get that structure that goes continuation High okay break break
1:10:33
this and we go higher we can all celebrate have a great week ahead I'll
1:10:38
catch you possibly next week on Monday but um good luck with your trading and
1:10:45
uh take care
