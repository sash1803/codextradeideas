All right, good evening people. We should be live. Give me a quick audio check that
0:15
you can hear my voice and see my screen and we'll kick off today's session. It's good to be back. I'll be running these
0:22
um once a month now now that I'm fing up the streams
0:28
again, but uh just waiting for the confirmation and we kick off today's
0:37
stream. All right, excellent. So, it's the 12th of May, 2025 today. The time
0:43
being 9:00 p.m. UTC. I've had a very busy schedule with um moving around um
0:51
trading in between and obviously trying to run the charity mentorship which we're halfway through. But without
0:57
further ado, I just want to give a special thank you to Soros. Um do check out their app. It's a fantastic app that
1:03
comes with the decks uh and a very very good wallet for trading uh various coins
1:10
uh on the slaughter network as well. Okay, so special thank you to those guys. And as always, anything said in
1:16
today's video is not financial advice. It is just my view of the market. So
1:22
what do we think? It's been a fascinating Q2, hasn't it? We've seen the lows of Bitcoin trade down at 70 776
1:30
give or take, you know, and here we are four weeks later from the lows. We're we're back up to alltime highs almost,
1:37
right? Um it's been a really wild ride. Certainly has. and um let's see what we've got. But before
1:44
we do that, just looking at the news ahead for tomorrow, we can see we've got the uh CPI data. So, in terms of uh
1:51
expectations with price, I'm not really seeing anything set up immediately. I think how
1:57
I'm looking to play this heading into CPI is just not rushing into any new positions. Just letting the market show
2:04
its hand and then deciding how I wish to take on any trades later this week or
2:10
maybe maybe early next week. All right, but I do think we we are in a very interesting point in the market and uh
2:18
let's go ahead and look at Bitcoin. So, what do we think, folks?
2:24
Um, we've seen Bitcoin rally from these lows of 75K. One of the key things that
2:29
I pointed out on the very last video that I did was this was the demand zone that you want to keep a a watch for. Uh,
2:37
in terms of price coming into this level, uh, that was on the very last stream I did, I believe back in March.
2:44
Um, I'm quite pleased with how price came into that level. We managed to obviously long from this level. Okay. In
2:50
terms of myself, I picked some spot play. uh on Bitcoin and Salana around
2:56
about you know Salana around about 100 105 is my average cost. I've cashed out a significant amount today. I'll explain
3:03
why. Um and same on Bitcoin. I think we've seen actually a very strong push
3:08
higher where uh for those of you who are obviously in the mentorship, you're you're fairly familiar with this. But
3:15
quite often what you see in Bitcoin, in fact to what I alluded to on the tweet the other day was that you often get
3:21
like a one, two, three drives followed by a rally, a base expansion,
3:27
compression. And at this point, this is where I wasn't sure whether we were going to see continuation higher or
3:33
whether we were going to get a pullback into that 9188K before we saw continuation higher. But lo and behold,
3:41
uh the very last trade I took on Bitcoin was long year 93 taking profit into last
3:46
week's FOMC and then overnight we got the expansion to the upside which I completely missed. Okay, cuz um I tried
3:53
to reposition into a short here, but unfortunately that didn't work out. But that's fine, you know. Um it's been a
3:59
good run nevertheless on Bitcoin. So very pleased in terms of a spot perspective. Now just looking at this
4:05
structure here, what I want to bring your attention to is, you know, this isn't unusual in Bitcoin. We have seen
4:12
this play out previously where you have one, two, three drives into the low into a significant demand zone. Price pushes
4:19
up. Like I said, it consolidates, builds a base, pushes up higher, compresses,
4:25
you get that final expansion. Now, if you look back to what we had in the
4:31
summer of 2024, very similar price action up until this point here, you
4:36
have one, two, three drives into the lows. And if I recall, I think we had a key demand zone over here. There we go.
4:42
Okay, this was the key demand zone. I remember this because this is a region that we were longing last May and then
4:49
again in August. But this again is very reminiscent of the price action that
4:55
we've just seen in the sense where we get one, two, three drives into the low.
5:01
And what does price do? It essentially gets a lot of people shaking
5:06
uh sh you know shaking out their position with it with a very good reclaim. There's your uh uh rally base.
5:13
Another rally followed by the compression into the expansion. Now, at this point, you probably think the
5:19
expectation is for price to run the highs, but it stops short, you know, at
5:25
71,000. And you've got a clearly defined mid-level in this instance. So, again, just looking at context where price can
5:32
and might just go in terms of where we are. It could still be rangebound for
5:40
quite some time. If we just run this forward, we can see the pullback that we get into the mid level. Now, this would
5:46
have been key for me in the sense where if I'm looking to long Bitcoin back
5:51
towards these highs and potentially higher, then you're essentially looking
5:56
for either price to find support at this level or you're waiting for price to take out the lows, then get back above.
6:04
Okay? So, there's two ways you can execute. You can step into the trade here, but you run the risk of price pushing lower down. At which point,
6:10
you're probably likely to get stopped out if your stop is just under these lows here or further lower down. Or
6:18
alternatively, you're running or you're hoping that you see some sort of run of these lows before we see acceptance back
6:24
above. That's the trigger to get long and you're looking to trade back towards range these previous highs and then the
6:30
range highs. Okay. where you're invalidated or where you would have been invalidated is is if price trades below
6:36
underside rejection then it opens the floodgates down to that 59k level. Okay. So let's just run this forward as an
6:42
example to ascertain you know what price did and and and whether the the plans
6:48
that I've just discussed would have made sense. So we get the push back up.
6:57
Okay, it's still holding that key midle. So you can see in terms of the expansion
7:03
that we've had up, very fast moves, shortlive compression, another expansion, but then this is on the 21st
7:09
of May, we're at the 4th of June. So two weeks of just rangebound price action
7:14
which is quite good in a sense where if we do something if we do see something
7:20
similar in this current environment as to where Bitcoin is I think that gives a
7:25
very good opportunity for altcoins to potentially catch a bit right so I think
7:31
you know that's essentially what I'm looking for some sort of rangebound price action with price holding up at
7:37
the mid level so now let's just run it forward to see where we current currently are in in terms of price
7:42
action with what we have today. Um, and there's a couple of scenarios that come to my mind here. So, you can see if we
7:49
just drop back to the daily once again, three drives builds a base, expansion,
7:55
compression, expansion. Okay, is this the last push or are we likely to see
8:00
one more push up into the highs? My personal preference here is I would much rather see a corrective move into 97s
8:11
being the first objective. If I can just get rid of these lines
8:20
here. Let me just clean up the chart slightly. Okay. So, my my preference here now, if you look at where Bitcoin
8:26
is, we've got the Monday's high, fairly positive that this is going to be Monday's low. and it kind of sets a
8:32
marker for me in terms of look if we start seeing acceptance below this probable Monday's low then I
8:39
think we can look forwards to a correction into the 97k level which is
8:47
this key mid mid level here. Now the other point that I want to make in this instance is the fact that if I just take
8:55
a clean chart and really focus on where price has been trading in this high time
9:01
frame range. If you consider all this to be just one big range as this was here.
9:06
It's certainly not a trend down because that that trend in market on the way down has been invalidated by this push
9:12
back up. So it's safe to assume at this point in time that we are in a rangebound environment. Uh and therefore
9:19
when you look at the key inflection points of price just as we did back in
9:25
2024 at these highs you can see where the majority of the time price has been
9:30
trading within this region here with a few you know deviations or under back
9:36
over again. Okay but they're all presented good buying opportunities. So when I look at price in this instance
9:42
here, if we just take this to be the key range, the one level that really stands
9:49
out to me is this zone here. You can see how price has retested level once,
9:54
twice, three times, four times. Okay, before we broke below the level, underside retest of the level. This was
10:00
the uh Trump tweet on a Sunday. Pushed up on a on thin books. But you can see
10:07
what's been capping price in terms of getting into this upper bound upper bound of the range uh resistance and it
10:13
sells off into the lows. But this clean thrust candle back up of the range was key. And I think you can't rule out the
10:20
possibility that again when you look at price, if you look at the key inflection points, let's go down to a 12-hour
10:26
chart. that when Bitcoin has traded at this 104 105 level, look how far it can
10:34
drop down into that 92 91K level. So if we do see a sharp pullback, you've got
10:40
to remain open to this possibility. But with that, I think that gives very good pullbacks on altcoins or at least an
10:48
opportunity to reposition back into altcoins or if those of you are sidelined, then you can certainly look
10:55
to to position into those um altcoins on a pullback. Okay? So, the the point I'm
11:01
trying to make is that, you know, you can never rule out the the volatility on
11:06
Bitcoin and the relative size of the moves. Again, here's another example where price was trading 103s and in a
11:13
matter of, you know, days or a week, we're back down at 90, 92, 91k. So for
11:21
me when I look at this objectively in terms of price action this this whole region around this 104 105
11:30
uh down to 90K is kind of the range that I would like to see develop if if there
11:35
is a possibility of that developing and then look to to trade that accordingly.
11:41
Okay. So again on the timeline I'm seeing a lot of calls for you know Bitcoin is going to go to 120 130 by the
11:48
end of May or early June and other people are calling for you know lower down Bitcoin could come back into 8378.
11:55
I I just think it's pointless making those predictions because what you have to look at is look price for now is
12:02
trading at a very key point in terms of um resistance. So you can see how price
12:07
traded above this 105 106 level was shortlived and went all the way back down to 92. Same again happened here.
12:14
We've never really had any weekly closes above this level. We had one two you
12:21
know days of price action above that key 105 level. But again when you look at the
12:26
weekly the highest weekly candle um body is at 105s. And again it's kind of
12:33
acting as a level of resistance here. So I think objectively when I look at this, it wouldn't surprise me
12:39
if we we do happen to get a pullback into this key zone here, that 90 98 97K
12:46
level because this was the the previous mid level that I had. If I go back to my um other
12:53
chart, that zone there. But ultimately, I look, I think as long as for as long
12:58
as price holds this level here, which has been key for for trading the entirety of
13:04
this range back in November, December, uh before we broke below this in February, obviously with the Trump
13:11
tariffs and all the [ __ ] show that happened with Trump, um I I think this is a good buying opportunity until
13:17
proven otherwise. So any pullbacks whether it's into 97 and we get a shallow pullback before we get a push
13:23
into the highs here. Okay, that's what I'd be looking for. Or alternatively, assume that we do get a
13:30
reaction from this level. Okay, but it's shortlived and we get a lower high in relative to this swing. Then it opens
13:37
the possibility that we could trade back into the yearly open. But again, for as long as that 91 92K level holds, I don't
13:43
mind any wicks below it and pushes a push back above and then back above the early open, then I think you've you've
13:50
got a good chance of really again, look at this price action here. You've got a really good opportunity in terms of
13:55
looking for longs into the range highs. In terms of longs, where markets are right now, I just don't see the see the
14:02
appeal given the fact that we've had expansion base, another expansion,
14:08
compression, expansion. It it feels like slightly not overstretched, but
14:15
it's been a very good move. But I just think longing at this stage straight into resistance up
14:21
here isn't worth the risk-to-reward. I I'd much rather long from this level here. Or alternatively, if we get even
14:27
lower down, then let's see what type of re reaction we get from that level. Okay, is that
14:36
clear? So, the two key levels for me in terms of longs uh preference wise, let's
14:41
have a look what happens when we get to 97s or alternative alternatively we're looking at 91 92
14:48
uh around that yearly open region. Maybe, just maybe, we push slightly lower, filling in some of this inefficiency here before we see
14:55
acceptance back above and then we can really go for the highs.
15:01
Okay, where I think um there is a
15:07
possible reason to think that we could be heading lower again would have to be below the
15:14
early open and the 705. I'll bring your attention to this level because this is very key when we start
15:20
looking at the moving averages. So just for now what I've done is I've made a note of the 97k level and I've made a
15:26
note of the 91.5K level. Um if we now look at the moving
15:33
averages on this again one of the main contexts in terms of
15:39
why I think Bitcoin is all right. I don't think there's any real trouble to
15:44
the downside is when we look at the bands.
15:50
Okay, let me just clear the chart. Bring on the exo trend scanner.
15:58
So, if I start up on the daily, you can see that once we reclaimed back above the uh
16:05
20th of April expansion up into this resistance zone,
16:11
um you can see the bands are fairly decent. There's there's no real weakness
16:16
just yet. Okay, we're not trading under the bands like we did back in in February, which was the initiation of
16:25
the downtrend. Okay. So in terms of support again you're looking at that 96k
16:30
level or potentially 99. Now what happens if you know we do pull back I think that gives a very good opportunity
16:37
that within this range somewhere within here um we can refine an execution point. Alternatively what if we trade
16:45
through the bands okay and then start rejecting then I think you have to be open to the possibility that we are
16:50
likely to see a much more longer rotational rangebound price action.
16:56
confined within the upper bounds of the range. But again, I think such an event
17:01
like that hopefully gives alts an opportunity to run as we start seeing some money potentially shift over into
17:09
the altcoin space. Where I think it kind of ruins the possibility of, you know,
17:15
further upside on altcoins is is again getting below that key 90 90K level I
17:21
think has to hold for me. below there then uh we'll have to reassess. All right. But again
17:29
remaining objectively looking for opportunities using Bitcoin's context with the view
17:36
that we can potentially start positioning into altcoins looking for
17:42
continuation higher on altcoins. Now what I want to also bring to your to your attention here is I believe
17:48
equities NASDAQ S&P and the NIK are also
17:54
up very key points in terms of their structure. If we just start off with
18:00
ES and I think one of the key levels that I was looking for um when I was
18:06
trading equities was for price to push back up into 5750 uh at least 575750 into these highs. We
18:14
we've certainly starting to see that now. So if we've understood how sometimes
18:21
Bitcoin can can be correlated to equities, it all feels like one trade at the moment where equities have pushed up
18:27
higher, NASDAQ has pushed up higher, NIK has pushed up higher, Bitcoin has really been on a tear. All markets generally
18:34
had bottomed around that first week and a half in April and it's just been a relentless
18:41
bit on the way back up. Now, what I'm thinking about here is
18:47
look, we've had quite an an extensive, you know, rally here. Is this due a
18:52
correction at some point or are we likely to see continuation higher going to all-time highs? But what also comes
19:00
to my attention is is something like this where we see a significant drop and it's just a straight V reversal back up.
19:05
Okay, shallow pullback and then continuation higher. If we get something like this where
19:12
price consolidates above these highs, it doesn't really push upon push up higher, doesn't really break down, it gives you
19:19
that rotational environment, I think you can expect the same potentially on Bitcoin where there's just a lot of
19:24
rotations between 97 and 106. Um but again if we do happen to see
19:31
ES as it did back in August 20 uh 2024 where you got a pullback into a key
19:39
level of support before we saw higher prices and again if we see that here at some point um you know does equities
19:45
trade back into 5500 before we see continuation
19:51
higher and and I think this is the one scenario that you've probably have to observe that if ES to start trading
19:57
below this key level and we see continuation lower down. Does that then
20:02
mean that there's a there's a fairly decent chance that Bitcoin could trade back into that 90 91K level? So again,
20:10
just what I'm looking for. It's not set in stone. I wouldn't really tie my bias to this. It's just an observation that
20:17
if I start seeing ES and ENQ pulling back into what is probably a
20:24
decent correction and it holds with continuation higher, then I think that supports the argument that, you know,
20:30
Bitcoin could potentially come back into that 90 91K level before we see continuation higher there. Below this
20:37
level, then again, like I said, just taking it from one zone to the next.
20:42
This is where I'm interested in as a buyer. I certainly don't want to be buying up here and it's essentially the
20:49
same on Bitcoin. Now when you look at NASDAQ again when price sells off
20:55
aggressively similar V structure before price spends 1 2 3 4 days and then it
21:01
gives you that deep pullback before we see continuation higher. So, in terms of the zones here,
21:09
um although I'm not sure we will get a deep correction without any real bad
21:14
data, okay, which doesn't seem likely anytime soon, I think over the coming 2,
21:19
three, four weeks again, if we see NASDAQ just like yes, if it starts
21:24
consolidating at this level here and then we see continuation higher, I think
21:30
Bitcoin gives you that shallow pullback as opposed to that deeper pullback into 908. 88. Okay. But however, if we
21:38
start failing and getting acceptance below here, then once again, you're
21:44
looking for price to come trade back into that 1900 level, 8090s for a rotation down before we we potentially
21:51
see continuation higher. Okay? So, you got a high, sorry, you got your low, a higher high, higher low. You're looking
21:58
for a higher high into into these highs here or at least back up into the uh
22:03
2100s. Okay, that's what I'm looking at. And it's the same on the uh Nikki as well. It's it's very
22:12
fascinating to look at this because again back in 2024, very similar
22:17
structure. If you just look at price in terms of what price did, it was an aggressive rally. It sold off
22:23
in August and by the uh you know the start of September, one month later,
22:30
four weeks later. So again, if you look at what happened with price in terms of April the 10th, that marked the bottom
22:36
on most of the majors, u and we just had a relentless bid all the way back up to the origin of the selling
22:44
point. But what happens thereafter is if it's short-lived and we start seeing acceptance below that level, then it's
22:51
quite likely that you're going to be trading back into a level of support. This down candle before the
22:57
market pushed up on higher. If you look at the 4 hour time frame, you can see that you've got a very nice
23:03
consolidation period, okay, before price pushed up higher. So, we're just coming back to retest that key demands on here
23:09
where you can start looking to to potentially position into that trade again. Um, and again, it's been a fairly
23:15
fast selloff before you see price consolidate, gives you a rounded
23:21
retest and hopefully continuation higher on. Okay. So with very good opportunities if
23:30
there is a pullback to trade that range and very clear invalidation points is such that if we break below any key
23:37
demand zone you're either waiting for acceptance to go back above or you just have to you're open to the possibility
23:43
that we're likely to head much lower down. Now given where uh I've given an
23:48
example of the uh nicay you can see what price did
23:53
previously again just very similar structure aggressive rally above the origin of the initial selloff which was
24:01
somewhat event driven with the uh the tariff uh whole tariff debacle but price has reclaimed this key
24:08
level. So the question now is are we likely to see price consolidate above
24:15
this level? Okay. Or are we likely to get a slightly deeper pullback into this
24:20
previous demand zone before price pushed up on higher. So essentially you're looking for some sort of higher low
24:26
structure before we see before we see continuation higher into these highs here. Okay. If again if you drop down to
24:32
the 4hour chart, you've got a really nice um period of consolidation here. Um, I
24:39
certainly wouldn't want to be chasing this at this point. Uh, so if there is a corrective move lower down, you're
24:45
rather looking at 36ers for that deeper pullback before we see price continue higher. As long as these lows are
24:52
respected, you know, I don't mind a wick, but again, if there is a pullback into this level, um that's certainly one
24:59
level that I'd be looking to bid or or at least use as confluence that okay, there's there's decent correlation
25:04
across all majors to suggest that um it's it's a very good setup in terms of
25:09
risk-to-reward. All right, so they're the three markets that I'm observing along with Bitcoin here. Uh, I just
25:16
don't think where it is right now with with all the major indices and where Bitcoin is. I I want to chase this, but
25:23
at the same time, it's just great to see a very good risk on appetite back in the market again, and it's been a relentless
25:29
bid off these lows here. Any questions so
25:37
far? Yeah, I mean, you can you look at you can look at CVD. It's not something that I personally use. I like I said, I
25:44
pref prefer just to look at price action. You know, CVD, open interest,
25:49
whatever it is. Ultimately, you're going to be executing off the chart. Uh the chart is your compass, right? It's going
25:55
to tell you essentially your execution point, where you're looking to enter the trade and where you're invalidated or
26:01
which levels you're looking to trade it into. Everything else for me is just if it's part of your system, you know, CBD
26:07
for example, then if you can quantify that and you've got stats around that, then great. more power to you. But if
26:14
you don't have anything verifiable in terms of like okay when CVD is like this and price is up here uh this is a high
26:20
probability sure or the expectancy behind that trade is is relatively
26:26
positive for you then you know if you have that backing with statistical data sure go ahead the odds are in your
26:32
favor. Uh but but for me CVD is not one of the um metrics that I really journal
26:38
if I'm honest with you.
26:46
Let me have a look. So, Nikki, demand zone. It's I mean, look,
26:52
you've got two demand zones here because you got the down candle before the move up, right? Uh you've got this level
26:57
here. You're right. This is also demands on but the question is if if you get a shallow pullback all right unless
27:04
there's a real reason for this market to sell off um shares the fan some really
27:09
bad data comes out Trump announces you know further tariffs or policy or changes his decision and goes back to
27:17
you know whatever it is you've got to be open to the possibility that yes we could come back down for a deeper
27:23
retracement just like we did over here right if you look at where this top it was at that 39 9k level 39,000 before we
27:30
saw in a matter of 3 days is all it took to get down to
27:36
35s. Now I think back then this was um event driven wasn't wasn't it was it
27:43
concerns around the yen carry trade back in September which caused markets to sell off aggressively. So, you know, you
27:50
never know what to expect. But for me, immediately, I think this 3600 level is
27:57
the first immediate level that I'm looking at in terms of support if there is a pullback. Okay? I'm not saying that
28:03
it's absolutely going there before it goes higher. I'm just saying that I I think it offers a much better
28:09
riskto-reward setup in terms of looking for long opportunities.
28:15
Okay, going back to Bitcoin. Uh I think let's just have a look at the bands now. So clearly I've stated the key levels
28:21
for me are 97K and round about that 90K. If price gets
28:28
there, I'll cover it on stream. We can refine it further. Let's have a look at some of
28:33
the uh moving averages as I was doing previously. If you look at the daily I talked about
28:41
again I'm not sure the 12 daily really holds much value in this aspect. I if
28:47
there is a reversion back to the mean the at present the band is trading around about 95 close to 96. So again if
28:55
this pushes up over the coming days and we do get a pullback into there it's certainly a level of interest. Now on to
29:02
the 3-day. Again, this is also a very very good signal because very similar to
29:08
what we had in in 2021, you've almost got like a
29:16
one, two, three drives into key support before we saw price really expand aggressively to the upside. And then
29:23
over four, five, six days, we got a fairly decent correction from 52 down to 39. That's that's a 10k drop before we
29:31
saw continuation higher. The key aspect here was that price did revert back into
29:36
those bands and trade below it. But the key aspect is when you see price trading below the bands like this is not to get
29:43
bearish. What you really want to observe is that price is compressing on the
29:48
inside of the bands, not pushing away further down. And when you get this level of compression, there's always a
29:54
possibility that we could pop straight back up. And when we do, that's generally a show of strength and we see
29:59
continuation higher for as long as we know that this now is going to act as support. We don't get back below the
30:05
bands. Okay? Um like we did here, you can see price pushing above the bands 3 days above it. The minute we get back
30:11
below, that is your sign that there's inherent weakness
30:18
in the market. So again looking back to um another
30:23
example here is 2024 September we pushed back above the
30:28
level short lift below the bands but the continuation higher was good. So again, if there is a a mean reversion back into
30:35
this key zone, that 93k level, 91k level, is is certainly the zone that is
30:42
confluent with the range lows that I marked out, that if there is a retest, then I' I'd like to believe this holds
30:49
and presents a very good long opportunity looking to take out these highs. Okay, that's where I'd be looking
30:58
for. And then going on to the weekly, let's have a look at where the weekly bands are trading. Again, adding some
31:05
really good confluence to to that whole region of 88.90K. Uh you can see where
31:11
price had previously previously found support. No real acceptance below this level until, you know, [ __ ] hit the fan.
31:19
But again, the weekly 12 EMA is trading at 92.6. The weekly 25 is trading at
31:27
89.2. So once again, another factor of confluence that because we've pushed
31:32
above this level that any pullbacks into here and price holds it gives me a reason to to look for longs from lower
31:40
down into possibly equal highs or all-time
31:48
highs. Is that clear? So in terms of context, just just really being patient.
31:53
If Bitcoin gives me the setup, great. If Bitcoin pulls back lower down, then I think altcoins will give you that
31:58
opportunity to potentially scale
32:06
in. Looking at the stock RSI, yeah, I mean, it's it's oscillating at the highs. My rule of thumb is very simple.
32:14
When price is starting to oscillate at the highs, I generally ease off in terms of looking for longs because I feel as
32:21
though the majority of the move to the upside has happened. But like I said, oscillators can remain overbought or
32:28
oversold for weeks and weeks and weeks, right? Which means that price if it's if it's truly in a trending environment,
32:35
then you know, we could see higher prices. But looking at the daily, and
32:40
this is where it gets slightly more interesting, um, in the in the sense where, look,
32:48
we've we've pushed back up to the highs. Now, if this does start rolling over, I'd be very interested to see once again
32:56
where does price come into if and when the daily stock RSI
33:03
oscillates to the lows. And like I said, in bull markets, every time we see oscillation to the lows, they often give
33:09
some of the best buying opportunities. you've only got got to back test the um and this is again how I use
33:17
supply and demand trading with a mechanical oscillator to ascertain if I can increase the probability of being
33:23
right from whether I'm looking to long the market from A to B or whether I'm looking to buy a spot. You've only got
33:30
you've only got to back test this again. Look at the lows here. Really good buying opportunities and again over
33:36
here. Okay, confluent with a good buying opportunity and and all throughout 2024,
33:41
we saw this pattern repeat time and time again. Every four to 6 weeks, there was a very good buying opportunity on
33:48
Bitcoin um on the tail side of this range of uh
33:53
reaccumulation. One, okay, two, there we go. Three. All very good buying
34:00
opportunities. So, that's something else that I'm on the lookout for as well for an oscillation to the downside. Let's
34:07
see where price sends up. Is it going to be at this level here at 97s, which is
34:12
your SR, or are we going to get a slightly lower pullback confluent with
34:17
this zone here, which makes which wouldn't
34:24
surprise me. Like I said, you've you can see how prices from this zone has traded back into 90. So, it wouldn't surprise
34:31
me if that if that move did play out. And if it does, then great. we can possibly look to long from even lower
34:39
down. Yeah, I think Eric, that's a great point. Eric has asked, "Do you think there's a chance to take out the recent
34:45
highs first to trap some longs?" Um, there was so much shorting over the weekend, which makes me believe they get
34:51
forced out before any drop. Yes, absolutely. I mean, I mean, the key thing is, right, the key distinguishing
34:57
point for me is is that actionable as a trade? Do I want to long this market into this level here? I I just don't
35:03
like the expectancy of the trade. I don't like the risk profile of the trade. And I'm absolutely open to the
35:10
possibility. Just because I'm open to the possibility of it happening doesn't necessarily mean that I have to trade
35:15
every single move on Bitcoin. I only want to trade the levels or the areas that make sense to me according to my
35:23
process, according to my system, okay? Where I where I have a higher expectancy
35:28
or I know the expected value behind that trade. But longing here isn't part of my
35:34
system. It might be a part of other people's system, which is absolutely fine, but it's not something that I
35:40
personally would take. I'd much rather wait for the pullback to look for another trade on futures. Uh otherwise,
35:46
I don't get the trade. And and if that's the case, if we do push up without any
35:52
pullback, then I would actually say that I think there's a probability that if we even if we swing fail this high, then I
35:58
think that actually offers a better opportunity to hedge any spot exposure that you have. And you're looking to
36:04
potentially trade this just as we did here back into that 90K level. So, you know, I'm open to the possibility of
36:09
even shorting this for as long as we get some form of acceptance back below. Then
36:14
it really opens the floodgates to trade back into this whole entire rangebound
36:20
area. Okay? Because it is at resistance. So, I'm not going to blindly short resistance. I want to see what's causing
36:28
price to trade up here. Is this shorts puking and therefore becoming forced buyers? And if they're for buyers in a
36:34
bullish scenario, what you really want to be looking for is all right, price pushes up, you get a shallow pullback,
36:41
consolidation under resistance. Anybody who's shorting or got the stops here now, that's what's going that is what's
36:47
going to give you that cascading move higher up. Okay, these shorts up here that have positioned think they're on
36:52
side. Okay, more shorts start piling in because all look deviation over back under short the level. But all this
37:00
short buildup could be the fuel for the next move higher with aggressive market
37:05
longs piling in. That's what causes those really fast explosive moves up, cascading
37:11
liquidations, spreads get blown apart, you get those very thin uh inefficient moves even higher. Okay. So, you got to
37:17
be cautious of that scenario that if you are looking to short this, then you've really got to be seeing the reasoning
37:24
and and and the context around this zone that okay, what is price telling me here? If it's holding up, then you've
37:29
got a problem. You don't really want to be you really don't want to see price spend too much time trading this area if
37:36
you're short. But, like I said, if you're if you're looking to hedge some of your risk or take profit, then, you
37:42
know, could be a decent level. But personally, it's it's not something that I would long into. And equally, I think
37:49
um a lot of my context really depends on what ESNQ NIK does. And until they start
37:56
showing signs of trading lower, then will I start aggressively looking for those shorting opportunities. But I'm
38:03
not going to lie, I do have a hedge on currently. I've I've hedged out some of my spot exposure at 104.
38:10
uh essentially was the reason why I hedged and the reason why I hedged is
38:15
because and I'm happy to get stopped out if price wants to push higher that's great. I'm just trying to preserve my
38:22
downside. But when I look at price action here, uh you can see again on the 3-day chart, what was the origin of the
38:28
move down? The origin of the move down was this was this candle
38:34
here. Expansion to the downside. Okay. never really retested the level
38:40
thereafter and we saw further expansion lower down. So even on the daily when you look at this the origin for me was
38:47
this candle body here and again due to the fact that
38:52
we've never really had a weekly close above 10 or 4.2. We've had rejections from that
39:00
level and we've had quite quite an extensive move. It's been a phenomenal move I have to admit. Um, I was
39:06
expecting some form of correction or a higher low to occur here. Uh, but that clearly wasn't to be the case. And the
39:12
market pushed up pushed up on higher. Great. Great for your spot buyers. Just just unfortunate that I never got to to
39:19
long a swing long from from down here
39:24
unfortunately. But for now, this is this is an area in terms of contention for
39:29
resistance resistance resistance. And again, so we'll see what we get. Okay, I
39:35
I wouldn't rule out this scenario personally and equally I'm open to the possibility that we might run the highs
39:40
before we get a pull back back down again. Then it's a question of
39:47
um has Bitcoin now printed a triple top or is this some form of up thrust after
39:53
distribution if we go to 120 and then we get the bigger drop. So again, loosely
39:58
held opinion, not really actionable, but you've always got these scenarios in the back of your mind that is this
40:04
potentially I'm not saying it is, but what if it is, you have to wait until after the event to confirm that maybe
40:10
this is all up thrust after distribution. And if it gets back inside the range and we spend 2, three months
40:15
up here, then you've got to be asking um some serious questions about is that the
40:22
cycle topping for the time being or is this all just a a corrective move back
40:27
down again? Who knows, right? Who knows? Not actionable though
40:34
because I I don't see the point in talking about these scenarios just as I don't see the point in talking about if
40:40
Bitcoin, you know, Bitcoin could come back into 85k. Well, we've got all this
40:46
area to deal with first. We've got this entire zone to deal with. So, I just don't see the point in in entertaining
40:54
the possibility right now or the probability of price coming back into 85
40:59
until we get back below this level. And equally, I don't I don't entertain the possibility of looking to trade this on
41:05
a futures account higher until we can find some level of breakout or significant breakout. And it's not just
41:11
a trap above this level here. But looking at this move, I it wouldn't surprise me if we see a correction or we
41:18
see a swing fill of the highs and then a correction. But either way, I'm remain positive on all
41:33
coins. I'm just reading through the questions. So if you if you hear a moment of silence, I'm just looking at
41:39
the comments.
41:50
How do you tell the shorts piling up? Well, there's a couple of ways. You
41:55
know, you can look at open interest, you can look at CVD, you can look at the footprints, right? Because when it comes
42:01
to footprint trading, and something that you don't see on a candle, right, is on footprints. I'll give an example.
42:09
You'll see a lot of even on the tape you'll see a lot of aggressive market
42:15
selling, okay? Trying to push price lower down. But what's essentially happening is say for example all this
42:21
aggressive selling that's trying to push the market down but it can't. Let's just take this
42:27
for example here. Assume there's a lot of short selling here, right? But this is all they can do. Clearly that's
42:34
telling you that limit bids are passively absorbing
42:42
all that aggressive effort and build up of shorts such that
42:48
once they get triggered offside you get an expansion to the
42:53
upside. Okay. And what you also often get is like say for example shorts are
42:59
selling into passive bids here. Let me just get a a different color for the
43:04
marker. Let me just do this in blue. So, here's an example. All right. So, you've got limit bids here, aggressive shorts,
43:10
more limit bids here, aggressive shorts, right? And all that effort, all that selling, and all price has done is just
43:16
move, say, 1%. Just say that's 1%. And the minute, you know, price starts catching a bid,
43:22
it's been backed up with um further passive uh limit bids. price pushes up again, more aggressive selling into
43:29
those passive limit bids. Same again, a more aggressive selling, but they can't seem to push price down. And eventually
43:36
all that short position that you've got here, what do you think happens when
43:41
these guys, these guys, all of these that were selling have got the stop above here. What do they now do when
43:47
they're offside? They become forced buyers. Okay, it's not market's bullish
43:52
and everybody's stepping in. Sometimes what causes the aggression to the upside
43:57
is actually short participants being forced to close their positions which causes those fast aggressive moves up
44:06
combined with breakout traders. Now when you know it's a it's actually a very good move is the fact that you will have
44:13
then when you get these thin inefficient moves up and price starts you know consolidating here. All
44:20
these limit bids that never got filled they often get moved on the heat map. You'll see it happen and then they'll
44:27
start absorbing price here any aggressive selling and the pattern continues further higher. So that's kind
44:32
of how you know markets move. When there's a sign of weakness, it's when
44:38
you've got essentially, if I just run this back, where when you see these fast cascading
44:45
moves up or fast aggressive moves up, how often do you see price just come all
44:50
the way back down inside the range, that's a sign of weakness. And we saw that actually a very brief version of
44:56
that on the lower time frames on Bitcoin. If you look at this here, um you can see how
45:01
price on the 1 hour, right, cleared these highs. But where's the
45:08
continuation to the upside? What caused this move to trade into 105s?
45:34
And there's a really nice way to view this data. If you look at um Market Monkey, which is, you know, a
45:41
really nice suite coming together. But if you look at the uh the
45:47
footprint on here, let me just get rid of the rid of the tape and the DOM. bit if I can just remove
45:55
this. Remove the heat
46:01
map. Remove that. Okay. If we just focus on this area
46:13
here. So, if you've got a short and all your stops are above here, look at this. And this is on the 4hour chart. If we
46:20
just go to the 1 hour chart, you'll see a large amount of a fairly decent
46:28
amount of longs at these highs. Okay, look at this stack of longs
46:35
up at 105.4, for 1.5 1.19. And then when you combine that on
46:41
the on the 15-minute chart, if you really want to dial in on the lower time
46:46
frames, you've got a a very nice P-shaped candle where the majority of
46:55
the volume is at the highs. Okay, the point of control here is essentially at
47:00
the high, but price has closed below it. So
47:05
again, is this aggressive market buying? It is. Okay. At the highs and is it
47:11
shorts being forced to close their positions? You'd have to check open interest and so forth. And then the
47:17
market finds acceptance back below this high volume area. That's now forming
47:23
your resistance at 105 between 105 to to 10 5.5. And if you look at what price
47:30
does thereafter, that essentially marked the high of of the
47:37
uh of the recent move up and before we saw acceptance get back inside. So
47:42
again, subtle variations that you need to identify is is this a genuine move up
47:48
or is this just force short closing aggressively into some passive asks
47:54
which is why price couldn't push up higher. a level of absorption before you see price find acceptance be back in
48:01
this low time frame range and then price obviously start selling off with some
48:07
level of selling off on the CVD as well.
48:20
Okay. Um let me just read the questions. So, I don't know. Does all of that make sense to you guys in terms of
48:26
understanding really what's causing these moves? Are these genuine breakout trades? You know, I wonder how many
48:31
people actually started longing this and getting trapped up there. And equally, Harmony Shorts had their stops tighter
48:39
than a um well, no comment, but you know, tighter than a whatever and and they've
48:45
just been forced to puke their position into into some really passive
48:50
asks, generating that liquidity and then push the market down.
49:03
I'm not really a big fan of CM gaps, uh, Charles. I mean, I I used to be Once Upon a Time, but for me, France is going
49:10
to go there. It's going to go there regardless of the
49:21
narrative. Thoughts on QE affecting goals? I don't really look at generators. Honestly, I don't look at that [ __ ] anymore. I mean, QE, you see
49:29
all these M2 money charts flying around. Look, at the end of the day, you got to put the trade on. If it adds if it gives
49:34
you adds to your confluence, then great. You know, for me, I I I've just gone back to basics and trading price action
49:40
and really looking at order flow. It tells me all I need to know. Volume,
49:45
footprints, market profile, order flow kind of gives me the reasons to execute
49:50
the trade. Um, and then whatever other sentiment there is, macro sentiment
49:56
probably forms 10% of my bias.
50:05
Right. Okay. So, I think we we can move on from Bitcoin really and start looking
50:11
at altcoins. It'd be a real shame if if we're really going to do something like
50:17
this cuz because then I will be really disappointed that we've never had the opportunity for a
50:24
meaningful alt run. But you never know, things could get really um interesting
50:30
later in the year. But let's have a look at some altcoins. I think what I want to
50:35
bring your attention to is when it when I look at structures like Ethereum. Okay, I've got a position in Ethereum.
50:42
Um it is a spot position. I'm not looking to trade futures on this. But when I when I just look at price action
50:50
here, I don't know if this is
50:55
the impulsive move before we start seeing higher prices, okay, or whether
51:01
we are still likely to remain rangebound with the previous lows being
51:07
in at around 20 cents. But either way, when you look at this, you've really got
51:12
to ask yourself, what is the point in shorting anything like this? Unless you're day trading or scalping this,
51:19
right, fair enough. But from a positional perspective, I'm looking at many of these altcoins that are down 60
51:27
70 80 90%. And I'm thinking to myself, all right,
51:32
between now and some point, you know, over the next 6 to9 months, I really want to think about positioning into
51:38
these altcoins because look, the time to short [ __ ] like this is is is that euphoria stage or when you've got these
51:44
cycle highs or a double top, you don't want to be shorting this down here. You you've got to really be thinking of this
51:50
as a base. And this is what I've been waiting for, right? These bases to develop. Now I don't know whether this
51:57
is likely to be the origin of the trend up or whether
52:04
we are just still within this rangebound environment. Do we see a higher low if Bitcoin corrects? And if we do, I'd be
52:10
very interested as a buyer. As long as Bitcoin can pull back, whether it's into 97 or 91s, right? Then I become very
52:17
interested in adding to my position or, you know, looking to build a further
52:24
position, assuming that I don't have one. But then I'm also open to the possibility that look, all right, I'm
52:29
not trying to catch the absolute bottom here. Um, if we do get a higher low and I
52:36
manage to fill a position at 30 cents, I'll fill one/ird of my position. If
52:42
I'm ready for prices to come even lower down, just assume [ __ ] hits the fan for
52:47
whatever reason and and prices trade lower down, then fine. I'll buy another
52:52
third down at this reclaim of this level here. Give me
52:58
a dollar cost average of 25. Ultimately, I'm looking for price to trade back up
53:04
into this zone here, almost a dollar. So, from dollar costs averaging for around about 20 to 25 cents, give or
53:11
take. You know, I'm looking for a a very good asymmetric opportunity to the
53:17
upside with a clearly defined risk below here. And so, I'm willing to wait uh for
53:24
these opportunities. But again, the key for me really depends upon what Ethereum
53:29
does, what ETH BTC does. And for me, I'm really looking at the memecoin sector. We've just seen over the last week in in
53:36
in a matter of what 3, four weeks, absolute, you know, memecoins
53:43
pulling three, four, 5x's. Uh, if you look at mud, never traded this, right?
53:51
Uh 1 2 3 four five daily candles are all it
53:58
took to to print from 3 cents to to almost 30
54:04
cents. And you will get this because why do you get these moves? Well, two
54:09
reasons really. Number one, the supply side is actually very very
54:14
thin. Okay, there's no resistance on the way up. Number two, you've got seller
54:20
exhaustion. Look at the small candle body closes at the lows. This is what you want to see is true seller
54:27
exhaustion into a baselike structure. And then you get this fast
54:33
expansion fueled by people who if this is on
54:41
purp and you get those huge impulsive move up. They get blown out of their position. spreads get blown apart, books
54:49
are very very thin. It doesn't take much for price to trade him up into the next high time frame supplies. And so again,
54:55
we are into a very key level of supply here. Uh and that's why I tweeted earlier on,
55:02
look, I I think where Bitcoin is, you know, we could see another push higher, fine. Um but I'm I really don't want to
55:07
be chasing alts at this stage, especially those alts that have shown strength. I'd much rather buy a
55:14
significant higher low. Um, and who knows where this could end up. You know, if you look at this price action here in
55:20
October, one, two days of price action again from 6 cents to 26 followed by 1 2
55:27
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Fairly decent 50% retracement of the
55:33
move before it took off again. So, if there are any decent retracements, then
55:38
not saying I'm I'm going to be long in this, but you know, I'm just trying to give you an example. Go USDT was another
55:43
one. I bought this at 8 cents. I took profit at 20 cents. Okay, I've taken profit. Literally, I didn't nail the
55:50
top. I wasn't looking to nail the top, but I think there's a decent probability that again, if
55:55
Bitcoin does start breaking down for whatever reason, and this then gets
56:02
below this level here, then I think there's a good chance that I may get to
56:08
buy a higher low. and maybe we get an even longer
56:15
drawn out bottom before we see price push back up into that 600 market cap
56:20
level from the lows of 50 million market cap. That's a nice, you know, probable 5
56:26
to 10x depending on how you position. So again, for me, the opportunities are not becoming a seller here. I'm really
56:32
looking forward to possibly accumulating positions in Q you know for the latter
56:38
parts of Q2 whether the market goes what a quiet period in Q3 then fine
56:44
alternatively if we start catching a bid you know if if we don't get the deep pullback from this point onwards right
56:50
using this as an example we've got a very nice pivot point to to get back into the trade if you don't get the uh
56:58
the deeper pullback in fact let's look at where the early open
57:04
is and we'll we'll bring up the monthly open level as well.
57:09
So, ignore the weeklies. Let's go to the higher time frame. Monthly
57:17
open. We'll give the quarterly MS and we'll leave the yearly open. We'll do
57:23
the yearly open in blue. And that's what we've got. Let's have a look.
57:42
Not sure why the yearly open isn't Oh, it's all up there. Okay. So, irrelevant in this in this context, but the point
57:48
is we still do have a monthly level here. And that's quite a nasty rejection
57:53
from a daily candle. Okay. I I think if we close out like this, then we we we could see a
58:01
potential inside bar here and then we might get a drift down. It's just a
58:07
question of when you drop onto the 4hour chart. Whether this is likely to hold as
58:14
support, okay, down into this level here, you might get a reaction.
58:24
Is this going to hold before we go higher or do we get a much deeper retracement and this is all just a a a
58:30
bare market rally before we see a bigger consolidation? But either way, there's some really good opportunities. And I
58:37
think the final pointer to all of this again using the trend scanner is where I really wait patiently for these type of
58:44
structures because again looking at ENA, I haven't touched this since last year when I sold at $1. But now when you look
58:51
at the um when you look at the the moving averages here, it it's still
58:56
choppy, right? Yes, we have a a relative higher high. The question I'm asking is,
59:03
are we going to see a higher low somewhere in here, or are we just going to drop down through the level and print
59:09
another lower low into a a slightly longer base? But if you just look at the curvature of the bands here, we are
59:16
starting to develop a base. Um, and again, when you look at the duration of this, this was from August all the way
59:23
through to October, a good three months within this range. So, you know, you
59:29
could argue this is the most relevant low on the 7th of April. Are we likely
59:34
to see prices just base around in here for the next 2 3 months before we get a
59:41
a fast expansion to the upside? Who knows, right? But I like the risk. I like the risk to reward. I like the
59:47
setups that uh are playing out. And again, one of my triggers on this is
59:52
there's a pattern or a structure that I look for. So, you see this often actually um this bull bear bull pattern
1:00:01
on the on the 12 25 EMAs that I've talked about on previous streams and it often gives me encouragement that you
1:00:08
don't ever see it on the way down, but what you're really looking for in terms of structure. So, don't just look at this as a set of bands. There's a
1:00:15
there's a few simple nuances that you can use to really think about all right
1:00:20
this is actually a very good structural market that could potentially go higher and that is what I want you to pay
1:00:27
attention to three things here number one is look at the compression of the bands at the lows okay look at the
1:00:34
trajectory the trajectory here is much steeper to the downside as opposed to here okay that's a slowdown in momentum
1:00:41
of selling you are building a range change bound environment having come off
1:00:46
a trending environment. You don't want to be catching knives here. You want to wait for this consolidation accumulation
1:00:53
like period. Point number two, what can you look at? Well, if you look at the
1:00:58
period of red, are you seeing any green structures here or periods of green? No, you're not. The first period of green
1:01:05
that you seen on the 12 on the daily, but even if you drop down onto the 12hour, you start seeing signs earlier
1:01:12
than that. Okay? So, you're looking for the cascade from the 12-hour, then watch it go into the
1:01:17
daily, and then eventually onto the 3-day to support the context that this is now shifting either into a trend down
1:01:24
or a trend up. But the key point I want to make here is if you look at the the period of the
1:01:31
red, fairly extensive, and then you get this short burst of green, but it's not
1:01:36
enough. Okay? Then you drop back into an extended period of of of red again.
1:01:41
Another short period of green. This is not really bullish. But this is on on this side with the with the compression
1:01:48
of the bands. You finally start seeing this slightly longer period of phase of
1:01:53
green candles with a bull cross followed by a very short period of red followed
1:02:00
by another longer period of green followed by another short period of red.
1:02:05
Flips green. There's your trend shift. Okay, very subtle variations that you
1:02:10
can look for on on whether it's a 12 hour, the daily. You can even apply this to the 4 hour, the 1 hour chart if
1:02:17
you're looking to trade the lower time frames. It does certainly add some very nice contextual uh views of structure
1:02:25
and price. Okay, so again, when you look at the 12-hour here, you can see that I had no reason
1:02:31
and I never touched ENA until last week. Why? Because we've got a period of red.
1:02:36
There's nothing for me to do here from a buying point. No, not convinced. Not convinced. First decent period of green,
1:02:44
very shortlived into these lows here. Now, we've got a period of green. The question I'm looking or the the thing
1:02:50
that I'm looking for on the 12-hour here is I'd like to see this become an
1:02:56
extended period of green maybe during the same length of time as
1:03:02
this into a shortlived bare period or if you want to
1:03:07
call it a bear cross whatever you want to call it back into a green that's my signal to start really thinking about
1:03:13
right we're going to shift into a trend here. Now the question is how long is this going to take or do we drop back into one of these phases which takes the
1:03:21
best part of another two you know one to two months but again opportunity at the lows that's the key point now I'm using
1:03:28
ENA because the the examples on here are very clean but you can drop down and see
1:03:33
this on on the chart so again if I use go as a as an example because this
1:03:39
actually went up to $1.5 billion in the bull market last year right if we if we
1:03:44
look at the uh the bands on goat using the
1:03:50
12-hour. You've got that same classic structure. Look at the period of red. You've got nothing to do. Very small
1:03:57
period of green. Still in the red, but now you're starting to see transitions of green.
1:04:03
Not only are you starting to see transitions of green, what do you have here? Bull bear into a bull again. Good
1:04:10
consolidation, expansion. You should see this structure here to add
1:04:17
confluence. At some point over here, you should see a bull cross on the daily
1:04:24
time frame. Okay, give or take. Somewhere in here, you see a bull cross. If you drop to the
1:04:31
daily, there it is. Okay, beautiful compression of the bands. Look at the trajectory rounds out. Loss of um
1:04:38
momentum of sellers. Sellers are exhausted. small candle bodies in an accumulation range since March to April
1:04:44
and then you get the the rotation up. All right, so very very
1:04:50
simple indicator if you know how to apply it to the context of
1:04:55
price. Starting off on the 12hour looking for the cascade on the daily. Now I'm looking for that pullback into
1:05:03
potentially 15 cents 11 cents. But if Bitcoin decides to go for 108s, 110s,
1:05:10
then it could be the case where the pullback on goat is is is very shallow. Okay, you might just get 156 cents,
1:05:17
maybe not even that. But we are into this previous consolidation before we saw
1:05:24
price push lower down. So this is where we currently are. We're just in this phase here. It's clear to me that if we
1:05:31
drop below this level, then you're looking for price to trade into these lows. You're looking for a reclaim
1:05:37
number one, reclaim number two, then it's time to go higher into these highs of 40 cents. So, you're looking to take
1:05:42
this from 15 cents, half position size. If it drops low, just get out the trade.
1:05:47
You're then probably going to see price fill in all this inefficiency and start building out a
1:05:54
probable bigger base. Okay? So even if this happens, right, just assume the worst case scenario is that it goes to
1:06:00
[ __ ] It bleeds lower down. Fine. You've now got an an equal opportunity if you
1:06:07
were sidelined to get back into position here with some patience. Inevitably,
1:06:14
hopefully, you see price sorry, you see price pushing back
1:06:19
up. And that's how you can latch on to one simple trade. good expectancy to the
1:06:27
upside. Meme coins will have their run, okay, at some point and you can latch on
1:06:32
to a very good multiplier there. All right. Now, what
1:06:38
about other coins like Suie and Salon? I think I just want to bring your attention to those as well because I
1:06:43
think they will give you a very good indication or an insight as to what
1:06:51
altcoins might do next. And this is how I use coins like Sue or Salange to gauge
1:06:57
the strength of the alt market. Now, if you look at Sooi, okay, and I I tweeted
1:07:02
about this that I believe $4 is where
1:07:08
um there's reason for this to sell off in my opinion. Right. Okay. And even
1:07:14
though I believe that $4 is a very strong level of
1:07:21
resistance, what I need to see as a trader, I'm not necessarily just looking to short this, right? But what I want to
1:07:28
see to support the possibility that alts could go higher. Well, when you look at the the broader all market, SUI was one
1:07:35
of the first movers, okay, in terms of aggression to the upside. It was one of the stronger coins. So if this is one of
1:07:42
the leaders of altcoins, what do you need to see to give you belief that hang
1:07:47
on a minute, altcoins could go potentially higher? You want to see it find acceptance above this key level
1:07:53
here because then you're looking for price to trade this range. And if Suie
1:07:59
can show me that, then I think there's a really good possibility that there'll be some decent appetite on other altcoins
1:08:07
which are showing good strength, primarily AI and meme coins. But if SUI starts rejecting from this level and
1:08:14
Bitcoin starts trading lower down and then SUI starts getting back under this level here, then it makes me question,
1:08:20
is this just is this daily divergence? Because if you look on the RSI playing out and are we likely to see
1:08:29
Sorry, in the daily um are we likely to see a deeper correction heading into the
1:08:34
remainder of Q2, Q3 where if we start trading below $3,
1:08:40
then we might have a bit of a problem and we could be building out another
1:08:46
base at the lows again. Okay, so again, opportunity to get into position if we
1:08:52
do roll over from here. However, if we see price pushing above this
1:08:57
$410, $411, $415, then great. We we can look forward to some continuation on
1:09:03
altcoins over the coming weeks. And again, when you look at the uh the
1:09:09
bands here, you could get a reversion back into the mean. You really want to see
1:09:14
that $335 level hold because below here you are then trading below the 1225
1:09:22
daily EMAs. Okay, then it becomes contention for was this all just
1:09:29
really after an extensive sell off a bare market rally on altcoins, not a
1:09:34
bare market on Bitcoin, but a bare market rally on altcoins. Um, and therefore we have to anticipate, well,
1:09:41
there's a chance that we could become buyers lower down. Now, Salana is
1:09:46
another one that's interesting because we've had this really nice move
1:09:52
up. If I just remove the bands again, it's been it's been trading really,
1:09:59
really well. Okay, for me, I position into some spots. Salana at the lows, you know, watching this come all the way
1:10:05
down. I like I said I exited exited my spot Salana at 275s. I was very public
1:10:11
with that. Um and I got to start buying back in once I saw the reclaim above
1:10:16
here. Okay, this is where I started scaling into some Salana with the view that it could go to 150s. It got to
1:10:22
150s. Okay, I traded this zone for for some very low time frame trades trades.
1:10:27
Did very very well. Missed the move on futures but no problem. I'm still covered with spot. But now we are at
1:10:34
that key inflection point. All right. You can see where it's been a beautiful range to trade in terms of rotations.
1:10:40
That 120 to 180 level has been very nice for those of you who like to trade
1:10:46
markets. Some really clean rotations, resistance, resistance. And
1:10:52
again, almost there again. Okay. And once again at that 180 185
1:10:59
level you've got the lower bound of the range and you've also got the upper
1:11:04
bound of the range. Now what I'm looking for in terms of continuation it's very
1:11:10
simple. Again, this is the reasoning why I think if Bitcoin gives
1:11:17
us or presents us with an opportunity to long either 91s or 97s, it's going to be
1:11:22
fascinating to see what Salana does. And for me, the key pivotal point is this
1:11:28
because this is almost like a reversion back to the mean, this green line. You can see where price sells off, trades
1:11:34
into here to the underside, comes back into this key mid-level and again. Okay.
1:11:39
So, you can see how this has been a magnet for price, this key zone every time. But what's interesting is look at
1:11:45
this pullback here from that 180 level into 150. So again, if we can pull pull
1:11:52
up into here and hold this level, look at the expansion that we saw previously in Salona. Are we likely to see an
1:11:58
expansion back up to 180s and then continuation higher into the upper bounds of the range? Probably trading
1:12:04
back into the early open. However, if we start seeing acceptance below where below this key mid level, then there's a
1:12:12
real cause or probability that we're going to trade back into that lower bound of the range just like it's done
1:12:18
previously. Oscillations. Oscillations. Okay, that's all it is. It's just a range until we
1:12:24
find acceptance from one side or the other side of the range. Okay, that's all I'm looking for. Key points is a
1:12:32
reversion back to the mean. Good buying opportunity. If it fails to hold increases the probability that we trade
1:12:38
back into that 120 level. All right. Now, what I want to add context is is
1:12:44
Oh, sure. Sorry. How I add context to this, I should say, is again using the
1:12:51
bands. At this point in time, I'm going to give price the
1:12:56
benefit of the doubt that we could see higher prices, but I need to be aware of
1:13:02
what's happened previously. We had a aggressive selloff in Salana, okay, from $260 all the way
1:13:10
down to $7580. We've pushed above the 1225 weekly EMAs, but it was very shortlived.
1:13:20
Okay, there's the high previous high. We took out that previous high, traded above it, got back inside, continuation
1:13:27
lower down. So, I'm also open, right, to the possibility, and I'm I'm being
1:13:32
objective here, is that look, we're above the 1225 bands on the
1:13:39
weekly time frame as we were here. What's nice about this in this instance
1:13:45
is that well if we do get a pullback into 150 155 you've got the 12 and the
1:13:52
25 EMAs between 162 and 155 but it's essential that this level holds because
1:14:01
should we trade below there again you've got a very clear invalidation point that
1:14:06
if we start getting below these bands then is there a possibility that
1:14:11
we see a revisiting of these lows here and you've got to be open to that possibility as well. So for me that's
1:14:18
partially the reason why I've taken profit on my spot salon or I've
1:14:23
certainly taken profit in two/3s of it because how do you think I'm going to get back on board? It's very simple for
1:14:30
me. If the market doesn't give me a pullback and we start seeing
1:14:36
acceptance back above this key local range high, I know for a fact that I
1:14:43
don't have to buy a spot. I can just look for a leverage trade and look to
1:14:49
trade it higher into this supplies zone here. Okay, that's how I can get back on board. Show me acceptance above 185s and
1:14:56
I'll jump back into my spot exposure or I'll take a trade on futures. But it has to hold this mid-level once it gets back
1:15:03
above it. Not a swing fail and then get back inside. Push above consolidation continuation.
1:15:12
Okay. And then we'll have a look at Ethereum as well. I
1:15:17
think I'm really caught in two minds about the old market because I'd like to
1:15:22
believe they go higher, but the market has to prove to me that it wants to go higher. Um, and
1:15:29
again, when you look at Salana previously, like I said, it's sorry, it's Ethereum in this instance, not Salana. When you look at
1:15:36
Ethereum, okay, high from 5 4,800 into
1:15:42
support, high into support, high into support, sell a lower down. Okay, sell a
1:15:49
lower down. Now, what's interesting
1:15:57
is you'd look at this and you think, oh, look, there's a range reclaim of this
1:16:02
key low here. This is really bullish. This was all just a deviation, right?
1:16:08
Look at this deviation. Any pullbacks into here, you're going to you're going to trade it higher. For me, I I just
1:16:14
don't I'm not convinced that we are in a position on Ethereum
1:16:21
where we're just going to keep grinding higher and higher and higher. Um, I'm leaning towards a probability, and
1:16:27
again, I could be wrong on this, so it's a loosely held opinion.
1:16:34
And for that reason, I'm remaining objective to whatever price presents me. So, the question I'm asking myself is,
1:16:41
look, this rallied up into this supply zone here. It was a fairly decent move without a doubt. You know, from
1:16:49
$1,000 all the way back up into 2,000. In fact, the lows were at 863. So, you've doubled your money here at this
1:16:55
point. We we're into a level of resistance. Um, so when I look at price here, if I
1:17:02
just map this out cleanly, I would identify this as my range high
1:17:09
and this be my range lows here. And so if I start seeing rejection
1:17:16
at these highs, which is a and and again this is just a hindsight example, but
1:17:21
I'm trying to give you context of price that if I start seeing rejection here,
1:17:27
then there's a really good possibility that this whole region may provide the foundation of
1:17:36
building a base before we see significantly higher prices later in the year. And so this now becomes my demand
1:17:43
zone. All this consolidation, any pullbacks into this consolidation are
1:17:48
for
1:17:54
buying. All right, we we retest that key demand zone. And so as long as this
1:18:02
holds, you know, you don't want to see, you don't mind a swing fill of this level, but you really don't want to see acceptance of price below this level and
1:18:10
trading lower down. Look at the time it takes to build a range from August, September, October,
1:18:20
November, you know, December, January, February, March
1:18:28
before we get a breakout. So, it really took some time to consolidate and build a range.
1:18:41
Um, and so I'm open to this possibility that given where price
1:18:48
is, are we likely to see some form of a range develop on Ethereum? But I again I
1:18:56
don't know that I'm just remaining objective to the possibility that look
1:19:02
we've reclaimed this level here. So again it all comes back down to where
1:19:07
the price can can hold this keys SR level for me this zone here. um and such
1:19:14
that if it does then great you know it it supports the idea that Bitcoin gives a shallow pullback whether that's 97 or
1:19:21
whether that's 91k it gives us that pullback
1:19:27
scenario and then when you look at this from a range
1:19:33
perspective where did price rally from previously it was from this zone here okay these
1:19:39
lows just go to the two-day chart
1:19:50
into these highs here. That for me I feel is somewhat
1:19:57
where is where we are at. We are into this high time frame supply zone. This was the origin of the move down in
1:20:03
February. Okay. So, we've retraced almost the entirety of the
1:20:09
drop and back up into resistance. So, the key question is what
1:20:14
happens next? And again, you can see why I've been taking profit on some of my alt
1:20:21
trades here because we're into high time frame resistance. If we're going to push higher, then I don't mind
1:20:26
seeing a shallow pullback into this previous mid-range.
1:20:36
So if there is a pullback into this level here with Salana, with
1:20:43
Bitcoin, with equities, with n with NASDAQ, if it all starts aligning quite
1:20:48
nicely, um not to say that we can't push up one more time, okay, and then get a
1:20:54
pullback. I'm looking for a low to be established and this to be the real
1:21:00
shakeout before we start seeing continuation higher again. Okay, that's that's the scenario. Alternatively, if
1:21:06
we start trading below that 2,000 level, then I I I think you're really looking at the possibility of a slowed bleed
1:21:14
back down very similar to what we saw here. So you can see the base that we built the expansion to the upside and it
1:21:20
was just a slow rotational bleed back down filling all this inefficiency into the base into a larger consolidation.
1:21:28
Doesn't have to be you know rangebound for this period of time. It could just be that we we're filling a lot of this
1:21:37
inefficiency. Build a base get back above and then continuation higher. Right? It just gives you that higher
1:21:43
low. Alternatively, I guess we'll be fortunate to buy backing out the lows again, right? But this is resistance for
1:21:50
me. I I'd much rather I don't mind a push up, but I'd much rather see a pullback over the next 2 3 weeks maybe
1:21:57
before we see continuation higher. Again, when you look at the stock fairly much daily is at the
1:22:05
overbought levels here into resistance. That's on the two-day. So, I
1:22:11
mean, let's look at the daily. Yeah. Again, the daily is topping out
1:22:16
here. And you also have a very nice clean rejection here because if you look
1:22:21
on the 4hour time frame for those of you who are into fair value
1:22:27
gaps, then you've got this level here. Okay, we we broke below this support
1:22:34
level, thin move down, never retested this level.
1:22:42
This is your inefficiency here. What does price do? Rejects from that. Fills in the
1:22:49
inefficiency. Okay? Because if you look at this closely, there's the consolidation. Even on the 1 hour time
1:22:56
frame, it's fairly evident. Support, support. Okay? Support, support, support. And then look at the expansion.
1:23:03
Expansion down, consolidation, selloff, retest of this. We never got the retest of this level here. So all of this was
1:23:11
the inefficiency. What's price come come back and done? It's filling that
1:23:16
inefficiency and it's also giving you a somewhat of a swing fail. Okay. But it
1:23:22
remains to be seen whether we see one more push higher up. We've just run this low here. Is this going to hold and we
1:23:28
get one more push up? If that holds, then great. Otherwise, if it gets back inside, leaning towards a a rotation
1:23:36
lower down again into a corrective move where we can start thinking about buying
1:23:41
back at some SR level to be defined later underneath BTC as
1:23:48
well. Really good move. I really like Eth BTC. The key for me was this. It it was um such a beautiful
1:23:56
structure. If you look at the um this candle here, absolutely beautiful
1:24:01
candle. Weekly pin bar close. Okay, if you look across the line, where are we? What did we trade into? We traded into
1:24:08
this previous demand zone here. So, we've retraced the
1:24:14
entirety of the whole move of the last four, five years on Ethereum all the way
1:24:21
back to this origin. And so, you get a weekly pin bar. Okay? And and I explain this to
1:24:27
those in the charity mentorship. It's not a paid group, by the way. It's just a charity mentorship. Um weekly pinball.
1:24:33
What you're really looking for is if you start seeing an inside bar here, you've really got to be thinking
1:24:39
about at some point this is going to give a reversion back to the mean. And
1:24:44
your immediate resistance or supply is this level here. So don't be surprised if you see an aggressive candle pop back
1:24:53
up. whenever that happens and kind of fuel the move on altcoins on Ethereum. Okay, there you
1:25:00
go. Straight back up into that level. And when you look at the uh EMAs, it's
1:25:06
reverted back into that weekly time frame band. So now the question I'm asking myself, well, when I look at the
1:25:12
weekly bands here, when you look at the trajectory, it's not quite come off yet.
1:25:18
It hasn't based out. Are we likely to see something more like
1:25:24
this building out before we get a move back to 04s? And again, if Bitcoin's at
1:25:31
100K or $100,000, let's just assume Bitcoin remains at $100,000 for the
1:25:36
next, I don't know, 2 3 months hypothetically, then you're looking at this range here. for Ethereum to go back
1:25:43
to $4,000, assuming that Bitcoin is constant at $1,000, $100,000, then a
1:25:52
move back on ETH BTC showing relative strength to Bitcoin is what's going to get you to get Ethereum to go back to
1:25:58
$4,000. Okay? Assuming Bitcoin holds up in this range for the next month or two.
1:26:05
But again, when you look at the daily, there's a nice bull cross here. Um so
1:26:10
again looking for you know are we going to get a higher low at this point in time or is
1:26:20
this going to give a a fairly deep correction back into the base and then we start building a bigger base because
1:26:26
that's what happened previously back in 2019 2020. Um you can see we had this expansion all
1:26:34
the way back up into the supply zone. 23.24 kind of very similar to where Ethereum ETH BTC is now. Before we saw a
1:26:42
correction and then a a slightly larger correction before it really took off.
1:26:48
Okay. So again, remains to be seen with with what we get over the coming
1:26:54
weeks. But overall, um, when I look at this, when I look at all the altcoins and I look at the
1:27:00
structure of Ethereum and ETHBTC, um, and assuming that [ __ ] doesn't hit the fan, you know, then I'd like to
1:27:08
think that there's going to be some very good buying opportunities in terms of, uh, positioning into those uh, altcoins,
1:27:14
into those spot plays.
1:27:22
Okay, have a good one,
1:27:35
Spike. How's it getting into the medship? The menship's going to be finishing in two weeks, so I really wouldn't bother if I'm being really
1:27:42
honest. There's no point. um it's going to be finishing in two
1:27:47
weeks or two and a half weeks time I should say. But is that is all that clear? So basically what I want to tell
1:27:53
you is that you know when it comes to altcoins I think you've really got to start planning about the possibility and
1:28:00
the probability that there's going to be some very good buying opportunities if we get some decent
1:28:05
retracements. Okay, it's not all doom and gloom, but you just have to have a level of patience. Alternatively, if
1:28:12
ETHBTC and Ethereum kick on and equities holds up and we get a shallow pullback, then you've got to be looking out for
1:28:19
those shallow higher lows on alts that are showing strength to to ascertain the
1:28:26
possibility of markets going higher, especially on altcoins for the next two, three, four weeks. That's all we might get. We might just get three, four weeks
1:28:32
of um bullish price action and then it all goes to [ __ ] again.
1:28:39
But I hope that makes sense. Looking at Bitcoin, looking at indices, looking at
1:28:44
Salana and Sui because you want to see those markets that have demonstrated strength show to you that they're going
1:28:52
to give you a shallow pullback before continuation higher. But if they get below their 1225 weekly EMAs, then
1:28:58
you've got to be open to the possibility that we are not going to go much higher on altcoins anytime soon. But at the
1:29:04
same time, you've then got to be looking at Q2 and Q3 as potentially presenting
1:29:10
you with very good buying opportunities. Okay. So, I'm just going to run over a couple couple more alts that I'm holding
1:29:16
um from, you know, the end of 2024 into 2025. Again, desync is another one.
1:29:23
Structurally, I think this looks really good. I'm open again to the possibility that this could have just been a bare
1:29:29
market rally. I'm open to the possibility that this comes back into these lows here. Um, so again, I'm just
1:29:37
not sure whether this is the move. I'm not convinced if I'm really honest with you. I wish I was,
1:29:42
but looking at this, I just think it needs a bit more time to develop. I feel
1:29:48
as though we could do with a higher low. If we get something like this, then it's
1:29:55
this type of structure that you want to be looking for on other altcoins, okay? Which really give you that explosive
1:30:02
move to the upside back into 3540. So, are we
1:30:09
building a base or is this just a shallow pullback before we see continuation
1:30:14
higher? 50/50 for me. Um, anyone is another one that I hold. again is it's
1:30:20
at that cycle low. Um again, are we going to build a a bigger base here? I I
1:30:28
do think when I say I believe the lows are in what I'm referring to, I'm not
1:30:33
referring to a specific point in price. I'm talking more structurally. I think
1:30:40
that you're either going to see this as the low and for some structure here to hold as a
1:30:48
higher low or you have to play the longer game which is essentially you're
1:30:54
looking for price to give you those J curve type structures right that I that
1:31:00
I talked about where you get a much bigger base over many many months and
1:31:06
eventually you see Price do this, comes back out, takes out the lows, then consolidates, then you get higher lows.
1:31:12
Eventually you get higher high consolidation. Okay, flagging and then
1:31:18
you get expansion higher, shallow consolidation, then you get even higher prices. Okay, are we going to see
1:31:24
something like this or is it just going to be more drawn out at the lows here for the next 2, three, four months
1:31:29
before we see a Q4 style rally once again?
1:31:46
Soros is thank you to Soros who have um partnered with me. It's what can I
1:31:53
say? It's it's rocketed off the lows here. So again, any any significant pullbacks
1:32:00
here, it's shown some real strength. 3rd of March it rallied ahead of all the
1:32:05
other markets really. So one of the first big movers from 1 to 2 cents up
1:32:10
into 17. Obviously I wouldn't advocate buying here but I think for me if there is a corrective move lower down then
1:32:17
we'll see what happens. And I'm finally going to wrap up on total two total three. If we just
1:32:24
look at price here let me have a look what these scribbles about. probably some something that I've done on the
1:32:30
mentorship, but ultimately when I look at structure here, again,
1:32:35
um it's not bad. It's actually very good. Again, when you look at this across the
1:32:41
board, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt that this is all support here. Uh and this is all just rangebound price
1:32:47
action and we're at the range highs. So we've had a quite the bleed off in Q1
1:32:55
into April and this is the first retest of the range highs. So if you want to see
1:33:01
continuation higher then it's clearly evident what needs to happen get has to get back above here. Not just a spike
1:33:07
and back back below but real continuation but alternatively you've you know we could
1:33:14
see something like this. I'm not saying that we we're going to drop all the way down here. I'd only entertain this scenario once we get back below this
1:33:21
level here. But just don't be surprised if we do happen to just remain rangebound for the next 2 3 months. But
1:33:28
like I said, I think with that comes some fairly decent opportunity. When you look at the uh trend
1:33:35
scanner, we're above the 1225 weekly. So
1:33:40
what would give me confidence is if this starts give me a cross at this point
1:33:46
here. Maybe we get a shallow pullback and then continuation higher into these
1:33:51
highs here.
1:33:56
Right? And that gives you that trend continuation pattern that I've always talked about. uh when you've got
1:34:05
this baselike consolidation. So what happens is and
1:34:11
and I'll show you how this works on Bitcoin as well. You have this baselike consolidation. Price trends
1:34:18
up, distributes. Okay? And what you have is
1:34:24
is the trend line, high time frame trend line. You're looking for a base to be built around here.
1:34:31
consolidation and then you get the move up. So, are we going to see something
1:34:37
similar to this on, you know, we we've got the base,
1:34:44
we've got the expansion, any correction and then
1:34:51
continuation higher into these highs could happen. higher low is
1:34:57
required here. And to to to show you that example that played out in Bitcoin, I think I
1:35:03
talked about this on stream back in March that don't rule out the possibility that this could all just be
1:35:09
a correction into trend continuation because if you look at price here, I think this is what I this
1:35:15
is the example that I used that what if we get a pull back into this trend line um and that could be our reversal point,
1:35:23
you know, give or take. And this is a common pattern that I use
1:35:28
on on trend continuation for altcoins. Um that if this is a base, then what
1:35:33
you're looking for is trend continuation
1:35:46
higher. So it could happen. It could very well happen. All
1:35:53
right. So, from a personal perspective, just to wrap up, I'm taking some very short-time trades.
1:36:01
Um, but I'm looking for those swing longs from lower down. Okay, for my short-term time trades, a classic
1:36:08
example of that was um Bitcoin. I did short 104s. Um, but
1:36:15
again, it's it's just in case of the possibility that we drop into 97, then
1:36:21
great. You know, it's a nice trade with a clear invalidation. Equally, if we start pushing back above these highs
1:36:27
here, I'm not going to [ __ ] about I'm going to cut the trade very, very quickly because that then tells me that
1:36:33
this market is likely to start pushing up um into these highs here and I do not
1:36:40
want to be standing in front of uh momentum. So, there is a risky riskier short, but the looking at the reactions
1:36:48
from this level kind of makes sense to me. I think Monday's Monday's range is what really matters here. So final
1:36:55
conclusion, I think Monday's range will play a role on price. You've got Monday's high, you've got Monday's
1:37:02
low. Not sure what comes next, whether we get a push lower below Monday's low
1:37:09
into that 97. If so, great. That could be a very decent longing opportunity
1:37:16
from this zone here. Okay. Alternatively, if price starts pushing
1:37:23
above the uh consolidation before the before today's breakdown. So, if we
1:37:28
start pushing back up into this level and closing above 104.8 105, then I have
1:37:37
to get out the trade because I think acceptance above Monday's high gives you a nice nice day trade, I guess, to to
1:37:44
108. if it's going to happen. Not something that I'm going to
1:37:49
be looking to do. I'd much rather shift my focus onto altcoins if Bitcoin is
1:37:54
going to go higher because that tells me then it's time to chase the beta play which is altcoins uh given a shallow
1:38:01
pullback and pushing on higher. Um XRP. All right, I'll wrap up on XRP
1:38:08
and then that's it. I think XRP looks decent. I I stopped shorting this because I I've had five shorts on XRP
1:38:15
and I got stopped out on my fifth short and I recognized at that point that
1:38:22
there's no point in shorting XRP because once we saw these lows and when I saw equities rally, NASDAQ rally, ES rally,
1:38:30
Bitcoin rally, um I tried to short my fifth short on this was here uh $2
1:38:37
level. No, sorry. It was around about here. I was looking for the underside rejection. Kind of sold off, popped up.
1:38:42
I cut the trade. Okay. Thereafter. Um my expecting expectation was for this
1:38:48
inefficiency to get filled. It did. But now we're above that level. So again, when I look at XRP, I'm not overly
1:38:54
excited from a bullish perspective. I just don't see the point in longing something like XRP
1:39:00
because, you know, unless you're day trading this or just trading this for a 2, three hour trade, um where are you
1:39:06
taking XRP? Because when I look at this, it's just it's just within this dreaded range from
1:39:13
290s down to 150s, right?
1:39:19
160s. I'd much rather trade something like ENA or mudang or
1:39:25
peanut with house, whatever it is, versus something that's just relatively been
1:39:32
rangebound for the last 5, 6 months. If you're going to trade this [ __ ] you're better off trading
1:39:38
FX. So, that's my view on XRP. So, would I be surprised if XRP comes up and takes
1:39:44
this this level here? No, not at all. No, it's just trading within a really nice range, but very slow price
1:39:54
action. Is SC in anyone? I'm not sure SC isn't in in um anyone. If he is, great.
1:40:00
But I'm I've been in anyone for for quite some time last year. um I partnered with them. I like I said
1:40:08
I I give a clear open disclaimer that I bought OTC and I bought some on the exchange and I still hold that position.
1:40:13
So for me there are some positions that I hold in the view that one day we get a
1:40:19
relentless face ripping alt alt rally or alt season or whatever you want to call it. So I'm never fully ever fully out of
1:40:26
the market there. There's always going to be two, three, four coins that I hold in the event that I think that look
1:40:33
these coins could go from a 100 million market cap to 5 6 7 8 900 probably to a
1:40:38
billion market cap in a silly bull market. So, I've always I'm always going to maintain some level of high beta
1:40:45
exposure uh with those projects that I think aren't going to just fall off a cliff and they can deliver. Uh for for
1:40:52
that reason, you know, I'm with Dyn. I'm still holding them. I haven't sold a single one. Same with anyone. I'm still
1:40:59
holding all my anyone. I haven't sold any. So, sometimes I'm willing to hold certain positions. If they play out,
1:41:06
great. If they go to [ __ ] then at least I tried. I'm It's not like I'm all in.
1:41:11
It's just a a small amount of my
1:41:23
capital. All right. I think that's it really. I've been on stream for a best part of an hour and 45. What I will be
1:41:30
looking to do is I'm going to be running these once a month. Um I'm personally focusing on other aspects of trading. I
1:41:38
I'm I'm actively day trading much much more nowadays
1:41:44
because the markets have been fairly rotational for me and it's not very often that you
1:41:50
see something like um I mean if you look at
1:41:57
peanuts there's really not been a great deal to do. Uh but the two ways I'm
1:42:03
looking to trade the market now is I'm still going to be intraday trading or intrae trading. But at the same time on
1:42:11
my spot portfolio, I'm looking to
1:42:16
accumulate positions such as these that I believe that if there is another aggressive alt run, then I think meme
1:42:23
coins will have the majority of the mind share once again because it's just it appeals to all appeals to everybody. It
1:42:31
is what it is. It's just a memecoin. There's no expected utility. It's just sentiment. It type, you know, as opposed
1:42:37
to a utility project. So for me, I'm really looking to position into some
1:42:43
meme coins, into some AI coins. I mean, if you look at FET, I think this got absolutely
1:42:49
decimated from $3 all the way down into 30. So, you know, the question is is is
1:42:57
this just a I wouldn't like to call it a bare market rally, but are we essentially
1:43:04
forming the the possibility of now what is seller exhaustion and starting to
1:43:11
build a rangeband environment? You know, are we just going to do something like this for the next
1:43:18
several months before we see another run back up? You know, if you think about it, I mean, I'm not really one for head
1:43:24
and shoulders patterns. Is this the inverse shoulder before we get a inverse head, inverse shoulder, and then you get
1:43:32
a a nice fast move back up. So, you've almost got that one, two, three drives into the lows again, wherever that is.
1:43:39
Rally, might get a shallow correction. You've got a very thin move above here,
1:43:44
back up into $220. So, you know, there could be some very very good buying
1:43:49
opportunities in Q2, Q3. And that's that's why I don't wish to be
1:43:55
overtrading altcoins. I'm actually objectively looking at altcoins thinking that there could be some very good
1:44:01
opportunities. Um, if the price is coming to those zones that are very
1:44:07
attractive for coin to $10, I can't see it happening. I mean, if coin goes to $10, I think that's brilliant. I'm all
1:44:14
for it. It just means that everything else is probably going to take off in terms of memecoin. So, if fcoin can get
1:44:20
to $10, then great. I'm all for it. Um, I'll believe it when it happens. And if it happens, I guess we're all going to
1:44:26
print some really good money. But the key thing is locking in those gains, right? There's no good there's no good
1:44:32
in in in being up in significant amounts of profit or unrealized profits if you're not going to take money off the
1:44:39
table. So, yeah, I I I don't like this structure if I'm honest with you. I'm
1:44:44
not a big fan of this from a a longevity point of view. I mean, yeah, nice
1:44:50
baselike structure here. Good trend up, you know, rally, consolidation, rally. The the key for me
1:44:57
here is look, this level here, this is very very
1:45:03
strong resistance. Um, and equally, you've got you've almost got a range. This is where the majority of the price
1:45:11
action has has occurred. uh outside of the the range high and the
1:45:17
range lows. So, you know, maybe this becomes a range on Fcoin over the next
1:45:22
two months. I think if Faulcoin is likely to push up higher into this level
1:45:28
without a pullback and you know, it could be a rejection
1:45:36
point before it goes even higher again or potentially lower. Or maybe I'm
1:45:41
wrong, you know. But like I said, I have to see what the setup is. It could if
1:45:46
all coins are going to catch a bid, then there's really nothing to stop it from just going all the way back up and you
1:45:53
get one of these type of moves. Could happen. Absolutely open to it. Have to
1:45:58
be prepared to take losses in this game. And when you're when you uh take a loss,
1:46:05
you've got to know when to switch your bias and go the other way.
1:46:27
I wrote an article about this. I really think it's a fantastic exercise that you should all attempt at some point, which is the
1:46:35
um it's on my subsack. Okay, if you go to traderexo.com and if you go to
1:46:42
process and if you go to this article here, reading the market in real time, a drill to build pattern recognition and
1:46:49
fluidity, it's through this type of exercise, right? I've talked about this. It's like a boxer. When you go into a
1:46:56
boxing ring without any training, you're probably going to get knocked the [ __ ] out, right? And I see it the same way as
1:47:02
trading that there is certain amount of work that you have to do behind the
1:47:08
scenes which keeps you sharp and keeps you fluid as a trader. And for me, this
1:47:14
is one of those exercises people often ask me, EXO, like how do you manage to flip your bias on a
1:47:20
trade very very quickly, you know, and and part of that is because every so often I trade a cut and reverse drill
1:47:27
and I've explained how to do that and which markets you can practice this on
1:47:33
and on the lower time frame. It really does sharpen your ability to flip as
1:47:38
opposed to marrying your bias and trying to keep shorting on the way up or longing on the way down. Just accept
1:47:44
what the market is. At times, you're going to be wrong. I only have, you know, on my trades, on my day trading, I
1:47:51
have a 40% win rate. It's not the highest. So I actually make take more losses on day trading than I do wins,
1:47:58
but my losses are very very small because of this drill that I've been going through over the last several
1:48:04
years. I know when to cut my trade and like the example that I gave you on Bitcoin that if Bitcoin is going to go
1:48:09
back up to 104.8 and I've got a short from 104s, I don't have to take a full
1:48:15
one hour loss. I can cut the position very very quickly and get out and I've just taken a half an hour loss. To me,
1:48:21
it doesn't really matter. It's just another trade, you know, but I'm not going to keep shorting it and then shorting it and then shorting it. If I
1:48:27
see reason to flip into a long above Monday's high and Monday's high isn't just a swing fill, then I'll I can hit
1:48:34
that day trade long and probably, you know, try to get a one 1.5 2our trade
1:48:39
into those range highs that I talked about earlier on, you know, but but like I said, it's not the trade that I'm
1:48:45
looking for because I think the better opportunity then in that case is on altcoins. So, I'm then using Bitcoin as
1:48:52
a proxy to show me that it wants to go higher and I'll latch onto some altcoins and trade that momentum, but it has to
1:48:58
get back above that level. I'll take the half hour loss as opposed to leaving, you know, my my stop up up at these
1:49:04
highs. So, that's where that exercise comes in. Right guys, on that note, I'm going
1:49:11
to call it a wrap. I've been on stream for nearly bloody all two hours. So, it's it's been good to come back. I've
1:49:17
thoroughly enjoyed it. I've got a shitload to get through with the uh with the mentorship guys and uh I've got a
1:49:24
lot of uh content to push out over the next two weeks. But thank you everybody for tuning in. I hope you found this
1:49:29
stream helpful. Um please do leave some comments, hit the likes. Please feel free to leave a comment in the
1:49:35
description. I think overall when we're looking at this market, I think it makes sense to look
1:49:41
for longing pullbacks simply because of the structure of market structure, the moving averages, the EMAs. I think when
1:49:48
you look at altcoins, if we have the worst case scenario where altcoins just bleed back down to their base levels,
1:49:56
then I think you've got to really think of that as a real good opportunity to thinking about positioning for Q3 and Q4
1:50:03
with with a possibility that markets may run towards the end of the year again. So overall, uh I'm fairly optimistic. I
1:50:11
think where my plan would change um is should Bitcoin get below the
1:50:17
yearly open, should get bit should Bitcoin get below 88K. And finally, I
1:50:22
probably should have mentioned this is if Bitcoin gets back below that 21 weekly moving average. I think that for
1:50:30
me is then I have to look at the market and think to myself, right, we have to wait for lower prices
1:50:37
to to potentially look for those opportunities. So again, the 21 weekly
1:50:43
moving average, everything lines up currently at that 97k level. whether we
1:50:49
get there in the next week or so and what happens when it gets there or whether it's 91 is what's going to be
1:50:56
key for me. Um but hopefully come June, we'll see where we are and we'll take it
1:51:02
from there. All right, have a great week ahead and a great month ahead, guys. I'll most likely catch you in the first
1:51:08
week of June. God bless. Thank you everybody for tuning in and uh I wish you all a fabulous month ahead. Take
1:51:15
care. Bye-bye.
