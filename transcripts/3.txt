all right we should be live welcome back to another live stream it's TR EXO here once again it's the 6th of November
0:08
20124 the time is shortly just after 900 p.m. UTC if you can give me a quick
0:14
confirmation in the chat that you can hear me okay and that you can see my screen
0:36
happy November happy Bitcoin alltime high and happy election
0:49
day yeah I think there's a slight lag but as long as you you give me some confirmation in the chat we will
0:56
proceed so as always anything said in today's video is not Financial advice it
1:02
is just my view of the market and my thoughts ahead on bitcoin
1:07
primarily that's what the key Focus will be and as always anything said in
1:13
today's video is not Financial advice and finally a special thank you to my
1:20
partners okay exchange where I work as a product partner and I've teamed up with
1:26
him so a big special thank you to them now if you guys remember I mentioned
1:32
that there's a possibility that I may be launching a four to five week free
1:39
service so I'm just going to touch upon that now whilst we're here so we will be going ahead with it it's going to be on
1:45
the second of December uh Monday the 2nd of December is where I'm looking to start and it will probably end on Sunday
1:52
the 5th now let's just get something's right it's not a paid group it's not a signal service it's not a financial
1:58
advice type of website like it's not a Discord or a telegram chat group okay I'm not here to hold anybody's hand um
2:05
what it is it's in partnership with my exchange Partners where proceeds will be given to charity and I'll also be giving
2:11
away some funded account giveaway prizes towards the year end or towards the end of the four five week mentorship okay
2:18
what you can expect okay is two to three streams or videos per week so that's
2:24
more of an in-depth insight into my mind basically how I plan for the week ahead
2:30
week ahead I'll do my Sund reviews share that with you guys what trades I'm looking at moving on to price action Concepts
2:38
some orderflow Concepts as well and how I actually not looking to teach orderflow Market profile but how I
2:43
incorporate that when it comes to trading Bitcoin we'll then touch upon how I use that for trade execution we'll
2:49
discuss trade systematization uh what a system should look like what my systems look like in terms of some of the
2:55
strategies that I trade that you guys can then go away and take if you wish to trade those I don't have a problem with
3:01
sharing those because I feel as though you can give your system to somebody but at the end of the day it all comes down
3:06
to the mindset and emotions okay you can teach 30 people the exact same thing in a room to trade but ultimately when it
3:13
comes to pressing that button and how you manage your emotions that's what it's going to come down to so again
3:18
talking about trade planning and the actual trade life cycle the steps that I go through from trade setup organization
3:25
planning preparation execution okay and then from execution management of the trade what I'm constantly thinking about
3:31
during the trade process and then how I look to then close out the trades and reset mentally manually journal and
3:40
throughout that process I'll also be talking about in December what changes I've made to my trading manual so
3:46
hopefully there's enough in that short four to five week process to give as much as I possibly can um I'd love to do
3:54
it fulltime but unfortunately I can't I don't want to I kind of you know it's very difficult for me to commit to
4:00
something like this but I'm going to try it for four or five weeks and like I said hopefully for two to three um
4:06
sessions a week sometimes there'll be live uh live streams sometimes it may be uh might be live traded sessions
4:12
sometimes it'll just be recorded videos such as a Sunday Market Outlook uh an in-depth Market Outlook as to how I uh
4:19
go about setting up for the week ahead and yeah just pretty much sharing all that so like I said um the only
4:25
precondition is that if you are interested then feel free to sign up using the referral Link in the
4:31
description of the video um like I said it doesn't cost anything and the proceeds I intend to give the proceeds
4:36
either back into charity I'll be doing some giveaways of those proceeds and we'll figure out the rest all right so
4:42
if you're interested that's all you need to know there's nothing to pay there's nothing to sign up for I think once you've signed up with the uh referral
4:49
link I will be launching a website in the next two to three weeks which you will need an exchange us righty to sign
4:55
up as part of that process so that's the only um part that you need to know apart from
5:01
that let's move on forward to today's stream okay lost my voice and brother come down
5:07
with a slight cold but we'll we'll get through right so excuse me talking about
5:14
Bitcoin um looking at this chart where do where do you want me to start you tell me in the chat where should I start
5:20
looking at this so I mean we can talk about everything that I've discussed over the last several weeks it's played
5:26
out fairly well all the way back from when I started streaming again which was
5:31
early September we were down here I talked about the fact that I don't think we're just going to ve reverse in the
5:36
next week or two which was fairly much pretty much the case we had a significant amount of range bound price
5:44
action and it's now in November that we finally getting the push higher so the first things first let's
5:50
just keep it simple let's start off with the EXO macro Trend scanner what does that tell us on a weekly basis so if
5:57
again if you follow the streams I've talked to about the fact that you want to see this being shortlived which we
6:02
got you want to see price reclaim back up the bands and hold which we've had we we should now expect to see continuation
6:11
higher okay I'll talk about immediate levels later in the
6:16
Stream but just from a high time frame contextual point of view this is the weekly chart we're looking at the weekly
6:23
1225 EMA the bands okay and you can see the context is to the upside we have not
6:29
yet had a bear Cross or a death cross to the to the downside and that's one of
6:34
the key reasons why I stuck to my bias that every time we've traded towards
6:41
these lows it's been a long opportunity because I didn't see the shifting context I also talked about the fact
6:47
that look just because people are talking about a shi in Market structure where you've got lower highs and lower
6:53
lows you've got to look at the overall context this was not a trend in Market
6:59
this is a trending Market that's the first misconception and misunderstanding
7:05
in terms of a contextual perspective that I saw shared across the timeline you've got to look at the overall
7:10
picture of price okay you don't spend 10 12 weeks in a downtrend going sideways
7:16
it's a range and in a Range you often have various structural shifts the only
7:21
structures that make sense within the range are on the lower time frames but if you're looking at this on a daily or a weekly then there's a lot of chop from
7:29
a from a market structure perspective and this is where you have to kind of be fluid to go with good buying
7:35
opportunities you have to trade at the extremes okay you're either covering at the range highs or hedging at the range
7:42
highs and you're looking to buy the range lows until you get a break of the that of one side or the other of that
7:48
given range okay the second point that I talked about was the monthly chart if you look at this look
7:56
at the Wicks okay what did I what did I cover on the last stream and the streams previous prior to though uh prior to
8:03
last week's stream look at the Wicks selling is being absorbed buyers are stepping in
8:09
aggressively when you see that you should look for a continuation higher unless we start closing below these
8:15
Wicks again okay so that's another show of strength in the
8:23
market um don't worry about the um um sorry I'm just looking at the chat we'll come back to the questions later let me
8:29
just go through the stream first okay we'll address any questions that you have if you have any questions or any comments please feel to leave a comment
8:36
in the description after the video and I'll I'll address them in the next stream okay now looking at um price
8:45
currently you can see that the the monthly Wicks demonstrated a significant buying we're seeing that continuation
8:52
higher the big question is okay is this now all just going to be a deviation
8:58
outside of the Range High I think in all honesty even if it is right in this
9:04
context now had this been 2021 you know the old EXO would have shorted this because it wasn't just the
9:10
fact that we're trading above all-time highs and it's time to get super bullish if you look at the macro
9:17
conditions at that time we knew that the Fed was going to be tapering we knew that there was going to be a rate hik in
9:22
cycle we knew that there was going to be a quitting cycle that liquidity is likely to recede in this instance okay
9:30
those preconditions have not been met we know that liquidity is fine growth is fine inflation is relatively modest the
9:38
question is well not the question are we in a regime of reflation yes we are are
9:43
we likely to head into inflation or disinflation or uh recession anytime soon in the next four weeks no we're not
9:50
so you have to go with the current regime and I'm looking at this thinking that look all right we've got fomc
9:56
tomorrow there's a good possibility there's there's some very good bullish signs and and there is a possibility
10:03
that people may start shorting this but the one thing I've said is all right you may get this pull back back inside the
10:09
range people may classify this as a deviation the first initial reaction is
10:14
it's going to go lower there's a deviation but my argument and just something something to think
10:20
about I've seen this happen quite often where price trades above the range okay
10:26
it hovers around here slowly drifts back inside what happens is shorts Pile in and this
10:32
is where you want to check the positioning I'll talk about this in the next stream but you'll see shorts opening you'll see a shift in open
10:39
interest when you see shorts piling in it won't take much to for price to push
10:44
these offside cascading liquidations and then you then you're going to get the big candle to the upside because not
10:50
only do you have shorts being liquidated shorts closing out being Force open Longs you're going to have Longs piling
10:55
in and that's why for me in this instance unless you're hedging against your spot position if there is a
11:02
break back inside the range and you don't mind getting stopped out on your hedge against spot then fine that's
11:08
probably something that I may consider but I'm looking to be aggressive if there is a pull back into this Zone and
11:14
and this is all we're going to get just a pull back into 7 uh 67 68 69 and it starts pushing higher there's a fairly
11:21
decent chance we could see continuation higher over the coming weeks now just bear in mind that there is FC tomorrow I'm not sure what happens whether we get
11:28
some volatility whether we get a shake out of late Longs piling in and whether we get some profit taken in hedging
11:34
right I don't know but just some signs to look out for is that clear I just want to understand if what I've tried to
11:42
portray and explain from a positioning standpoint from a price action
11:47
standpoint what to expect if there is if we are to see price trading back
11:53
within the range it doesn't necessarily mean it's a deviation it's not confirmed we don't know whether it's confirmed you
12:00
can only play the probability and if it breaks down further down then yeah you can you get the confirmation but just be
12:06
careful again if you're aggressively shorting this that this isn't just a trap on shorts before we see prices go
12:14
higher at the end of the at the end of the day you are going against the momentum you are going against the
12:21
market structure and you are essentially almost all but fading the first breakout of a range after you know since uh March
12:29
the 14th 15th we've taken out these highs every single high has been taken out now so unless there compelling
12:36
reason for me to Short this I'm just being cautious from an aggressive short more from a hedge perspective would make
12:43
sense to me against my spot which my spot entries have from have been from down here now in terms
12:50
of in terms of going higher If This truly is a b Market which
12:57
I'm quietly confident at this stage that we will likely I'm well I'm hoping or I'm playing towards the probability of
13:04
going higher let's talk about mapping out the macro range now this is a good example of how I use range extension
13:11
points and I'll also use some trend lines as a projection point where price
13:16
could potentially trade up into now if you understand the concepts of range trading it doesn't matter what the time
13:22
frame is whether it's a 1 minute 5 minute 30 minute one we chart the concepts that I use around the the key
13:29
inflection points are always the same the only difference being is that the time frame is higher now you've
13:36
got your range lows here let me just go into a 3-day
13:46
chart taking the previous all-time high this more or less defines my range
13:53
lows okay with the deviation equally up at the range highs that's my range highs there
14:01
okay taking the mid between the two puts me in around
14:12
here on this the reason I'm doing this from scratch is just so that you understand how I'm mapping this out now
14:19
I take a range extension just as it is sorry B with one second just as it
14:26
is and Mark this out here this Range High where we've had resistance
14:31
resistance okay price trading over the Level under the level back over and
14:37
holding that 66 66k level is what I want to see hold as support if there is any
14:44
pullback the range extension to the upside now is giving me something around
14:50
115 120 I haven't mapped this out exactly to point but you kind of get the gist how you wish to go ahead and do
14:56
that is entirely up to you then we've got the mid-range point of the extension coming coming in at around
15:03
90k these are the high time frame inflection points or high time frame
15:09
levels that I'm using as price targets pivotal points now in between
15:17
there and you've probably seen me do this is do the range quarters as
15:24
well got one out around about 80k and then the other one is probably somewhere round about here 100 102 103 okay you
15:32
can map it out precisely however you
15:38
wish and the same would have been on the uh opposing end down
15:43
here where we had the range quarter which was acting as a key pivotal level for me okay just around
15:51
about there give or take and that was confluent with this demand Zone that we had here okay this
15:59
was the level that I was insistent that for us as long as price is below is
16:04
above the yearly mid level this was our yearly low this was our yearly high this was our yearly mid level I'm just going
16:11
to mark that out in blue now in terms of context let me just do this as a solid
16:20
line okay there's our projected range highs it's just a projection it's not a
16:27
certainty this now becomes our mid-range this becomes a um the the high
16:33
time frame range quarter and this is all I'm focusing now over the coming weeks so instant
16:39
instantaneously looking at this I want to see this level hold as
16:45
support and I think when you look at this objectively when you zoom out of price I've got no real concerns I would
16:53
welcome a pullback to go long on Futures anything anywhere into the previous highs
16:59
not the best line of drawn but you kind of get the gist anywhere into 70 71 72 68 I'd be
17:07
looking for that continuation High first objective 80k second objective 90k over the coming weeks and months okay where I
17:14
would be concerned is if there is a break not only of this level but
17:22
acceptance below it and therefore are breaking this trend line I'm not looking at anything else just pure price action
17:29
structure if there is a break of this that then becomes a slightly bigger
17:34
problem and therefore we are still back within that range perhaps deeper than I would like so that's the one scenario
17:43
that I don't want to see if my expectation is for prices to go higher I don't mind a shall pullback bullish
17:50
looking for Longs break below there and the trend line and get back under back under 66 slight cost of concern I may be
17:57
forced to start hedging out or taking profit on some of my spot positioning that I've built up over the last several
18:03
months is that
18:11
clear now it's objective which swing points you want to take for me I want to
18:16
use the candle body close on the 3-day this level here okay not this this
18:23
is historical context this was the last relevant swing high before we had price
18:29
trading above and under if you look at the monthly we never you can see how clean
18:37
this level has been right we traded above it for a month we we Clos above it
18:42
and then we Clos straight back under and look where we rejected rejection and again and again pushed above it retest
18:50
that level this is why it's key for me this 66
18:56
67 refine it yourself in terms of the Precision points but you should understand the context that I'm trying
19:02
to share with you why this is now the key level that I want to see hold I don't mind a retest a shallow pullback
19:10
maybe after fomc and then continuation higher the other factor is that we are
19:17
now above November's monthly open so another reason that if there is a pull
19:23
back into this level and it reclaims back above that's another fact factor of
19:29
Confluence to look for Longs any
19:36
questions with regards to
19:44
that and if it was fairly bearish or if there was
19:50
concern of price going lower down then the other question you want to be asking yourself
19:57
is how much time does price spend above the previous all-time highs if it's not
20:02
been instantly rejected and it just hovers here and there's no continuation and there's a
20:07
lot of stale Longs opening here they may get squeezed out flushed out and then we may see continuation High what do you do
20:13
in the scenario where it doesn't give you the pullback what do you do if this is the break out of the
20:18
range the way I play it tough [ __ ] you should have got into position last week or you should have got into position I
20:25
shared my uh charts um on the stream sorry the timeline last week I uh I
20:31
think I updated today yesterday the pullback into into this level here in
20:37
the bull market when you see strength in the market you'll never get you'll never get a sweep of these lows most of the
20:43
time what you will find is price gets very very close to these swing points
20:49
but it respects it in terms of let me just do this again in terms of
20:56
respecting price respecting swing points okay if you look at this look at this
21:01
low here did we ever take this out no came very close but didn't didn't take
21:07
it out same again price pushes High did we take this swing out no comes very close continuation higher retraces into
21:15
a fairly significant level did we take this swing out no we didn't continues again higher this is indicative of
21:23
something that you'll often see when the market is showing strength you never get
21:29
those clean swing fails that you may be used to in the range B environment like
21:35
this give you a clear signal you got to be slightly more aggressive in this instance and it's certainly the case
21:41
when you have a trend in Market okay when you have a trending market and this's compression before continuation
21:48
you'll see again very similar structures when it's bullish we've taken out these lows look
21:54
at this swing low swing low swing low swing low look how close it gets to
22:00
taking price out but it can't and when you see this type of structure happening and
22:06
forming the minute it goes above it's it's time to take off all right and you get the fast moves up so this type of
22:14
compression is a bullish structure and then you get the breakout so again the question is now are we likely to see
22:20
this on bitcoin over the coming days or weeks just a little bit edgy with regards to uh fomc tomorrow but again if
22:28
there is any pullbacks then I don't suspect I suspect they won't be very deep maybe that's the best we're going
22:33
to get before continuation higher I'm wrong if we break below 66 then I'll
22:38
have to reassess and that's just the nature of trading I don't know I don't hold a crystal ball I couldn't tell you
22:44
but I'm leaning with the probability that we will see Trend continuation out of this 6 s month range and I want to
22:50
flow with the trend until proven otherwise and I have to shift my uh contextual
22:56
bias yes I look at moving averages if you look at if you look at the uh EXO um
23:01
Trend scanner even on the daily this looks great so even the dailies are coming in at 69 70k so even if there is
23:07
a pullback let's just assume there is a pullback I'm not saying it's guaranteed it may not even happen we may just get a shallow pullback into the previous
23:14
all-time highs before we see continuation higher right but even from a moving average
23:21
perspective we this is has this has not flipped um bearish once in the context
23:28
of the 12 25 EMAs on The Daily and that's all I'm looking to do
23:34
objectively work working price on Futures with my spot from one zone to
23:40
the next from one level to the next okay where I may be looking to take profit on my Futures trade if if we see something
23:47
like this then I may look to cash some some off okay or I may look to hedge my spot if I get the over and the back
23:54
under and is a shallow pullback and whether it reclaims then I'm looking for Trend continuation higher so the only
24:01
time that I'd be looking to short is not because I'm outright shorting the market
24:06
it's because I want to have some cover and lock in the gains that I've made on
24:12
my spot position that I've Reb back in at here looking for those Hedges that's
24:18
just personally how I'm looking to play you don't have to play that way if you believe Bitcoin is going to go significantly higher to 90 100 120k then
24:27
you do what's best to you I'm just talking about at the end of the day I want to lock in the game whilst
24:32
maintaining my exposure this is possibly not that I am it depends on the price
24:39
action how price action develops just one of the ways I'm looking to lock in those gains I'm being fluid and if price
24:46
is going to show me continuation higher then I'll happily cut the short and let price continue higher if there's a
24:53
deeper pullback guess what I'm now going to look for Longs with my spot Holdings I'm going to look for Longs on purps and
24:59
look for continuation higher so it just gives me that flexibility of trading the market locking in gains it is a slightly
25:06
busy style but look at the end of the day I don't have to repeat myself you know in terms of trading
25:12
Bitcoin I have made far greater gains right trading this range and trading
25:20
this range over the last six months which many set setups that I've shared on stream on the timeline from a long
25:27
perspective several times I've longed this 50 58 55 52 Zone up into the 68 70 several times
25:36
the gains that I've made in here have exceeded me simply buying spot and
25:41
holding it all the way up here prices are nothing for 7 months so a range for me is one of my favorite environments
25:48
that I enjoy trading we had that range down uh from 18 to 25 25 to 30 there
25:55
were trades to be had back and forth okay same again here now if we are shifting context this is where I'll
26:02
probably stop um reduce the number of Trades that I take and if we are in a
26:07
trending environment then I want to flow with the trend to the upside so again if this is now to be a trending environment
26:14
over the coming weeks I don't want to get chopped up trading this aggressively I just want to look for those
26:19
significant pullbacks if there are any and in a bull market in a trending Market if there's anything that you
26:24
should know is that pullbacks are very shallow you're never going to get the perfect pullback and number two you have to be slightly aggressive with a very
26:31
good invalidation level before you see continuation higher and you will get these aggressive flushes to the downside
26:38
as well when they do happen they're very fast and and they they they show
26:45
strength and continuation higher you've already got you've only got to back test previous rallies and look at how price
26:52
when it when it breaks above range the moves can be aggressive the pullbacks can be shallow rally consol
26:58
consolidation rally and then you get this fast sell off before you see continuation High it really doesn't waste time you'll see signs of that by
27:05
the Wicks of buyer stepping in these kind of lows being respected and then continuation higher it's very very
27:12
shortlived in terms of consolidation and then you get the continuation higher you're not going to get one of these long drawn out bases this is after a
27:20
significant selloff you're looking for Trend continuation higher and if you really want to keep it simple and flow
27:26
with the trend of price then delete
27:33
everything one of my um other favorite moving averages
27:46
is is a 21 daily uh 21 weekly EMA
27:59
you want to see the trajectory of this start turning up okay and for as long as price is above this
28:05
level I'm not particularly
28:12
concerned that's kind of the formation that I want to see on the moving averages to go
28:24
higher let's look at the uh the stocks
28:30
weekly this is fine like I said in a trending environment what you will often find is that don't pay attention right
28:37
don't give this don't let the stocks or the oscillators be your primary focus so rule number one in a trending
28:46
Market oscillators can remain oversold or overbought longer
28:53
than you can possibly anticipate it's really not ideal to try to catch tops or
28:59
bottoms when you see oscillators overextended in a trending Market in
29:05
range B market that's fine completely different environment contextually but
29:10
in a trend be careful so the the weekly is fine okay it could still oscillate at
29:15
the highs for several weeks something you have to look out for whilst price
29:21
continues trending higher okay you saw that
29:26
here it reached the highs in November 20 went sideways for 3 4 months and this is
29:33
where price ended up you got the and in when you have indications of a very
29:40
strong bully market look at the oscillator curling down and yet price is going higher all right so just some subtleties
29:47
to be aware of in that respect then when you look at the macd
29:53
on the weekly basis what's this here for the first
29:58
time we've been range Bound for so many months what's happening
30:06
here you can see the dissipation of the momentum to the downside and then the dissipation of momentum to the upside
30:12
and now you finally got the uh the cross on the macd this is not an
30:18
environment where immediately what I want what I want to be thinking about oh let let me see where I can show it's
30:24
completely completely different contextual environment compared to where we were when I was shorting
30:29
this after several weeks of distribution and then the fact that we had a swing fail and a
30:35
deviation with a backdrop of uh bearish sentiment with the macd that had already
30:41
crossed bullish and now was curling ground with the stock RSI at the cycle
30:46
highs on the tail side that was where I got out the market okay 6 well I got it
30:52
before actually I sold on the way up but this is where I shifted context and for those who have followed me for the four
30:58
years was where I became bearish okay redistribution continuation higher uh
31:04
lower sorry not higher redistribution continuation lower in this instance Trend
31:10
up reaccumulation looking for Trend higher Trend down redistribution Trend
31:17
down into base Trend up reaccumulation Trend up before we see
31:24
some form of a top forming possibly I don't know when I'm not going to discuss that right
31:31
now and then you've got the
31:36
RSI let's look at the RSI on the weekly so notice that I'm paying
31:41
attention first of all to the higher time frames look at the RSI and I we covered this a few weeks
31:48
ago that as long as the RSI stays above 50 and we are starting to print higher
31:54
highs and higher lows again in terms of a a shif in context the fact that we had one two three attempts to break below
32:00
this demand Zone and we couldn't the Assumption then has to be price is likely to OS it to the highs
32:06
again which it has and there's not been any harsh rejection just
32:11
yet and the RSI is above above the 50 level and it spent several weeks or
32:18
months consolidating at these key points so everything I look at on the
32:26
chart tells me that the probability is continuation to the
32:32
upside barring any pullbacks where I'm happy to shift my bias is if I see a
32:38
change in structure if I see 66k break down then I have to accept that there's
32:44
every possibility that we're likely to trade back inside the range which I hope we don't because we've been there for six seven
32:50
months and we'll just have to play the range bound environment until we get a break out of either side of the range
32:57
okay
33:13
so apart from that in terms of technical levels there there's really not much else I can give in terms of Bitcoin
33:20
other than the levels I've defined based upon the high time frame context that I've mapped out early with with the
33:26
range extension point points the other aspect which I was supposed to cover with look again this
33:32
isn't really technical analysis I don't think I can derive much from this it's just a meme a meme line but look if
33:39
there is a possible trajectory then I often use double trend
33:46
lines where I have one against the the uh the candle bodies of
33:52
price and then the other for the uh kind of like the wigs so again just something
33:58
that I've developed myself over the years as a projection when I look at
34:04
this and I think you know what considering where the range was that I marked out okay let's just assume that's
34:11
one range point
34:22
there are we likely to see Bitcoin push up into here somewhere 100k
34:29
and then come back down again then what you got to be prepared for this what if it does this and you get euphoric and
34:35
carried away when you could have used this pivotal range extension to think oh you know what maybe it's a good point to
34:42
get out the market or take some profit if we get this uh over and under of this
34:48
range extension here into this trend line then what so again I I don't know
34:53
whether it's going to happen but it's good to have the foresight where if Bitcoin does trade significantly higher
34:59
where do you want to pay yourself at what price are you are you looking to take some off the table or are you just
35:06
are you happy holding this for the next 10 years fine uh you can hold a portion you can sell it all you can just log off
35:12
and come back in 10 years time no problem but you know for those of us who who wish to trade or lock in some of the
35:19
gains you'd have to sell your Bitcoin I probably won't at this point I'll probably be looking to hedge my spot
35:24
exposure if this scenario occurs and we we we could potentially trade back into
35:29
this 67k level 3 to six months time I don't know I just don't know I I I
35:35
couldn't tell you I only know as much as you guys do where price is heading or where price could potentially go I don't
35:41
have a crystal ball I can only look at I can only look to react at the chart you know what the inflection points are and
35:48
then just every day my decision on my mind will change because as new data is printed and available my my
35:55
reasoning and my thought process will change on a daily basis so it doesn't matter what the [ __ ] I said 2 3 4 weeks
36:01
ago all that matters is what is happening now and what could potentially happen tomorrow and what what am I
36:07
looking to do in terms of playing the markets in terms of taking profit in terms of hedging out in terms of taking
36:13
on further
36:18
risk and all I try to do on these streams you know I don't I don't go into the the widths of orderflow trading or
36:25
Market profile or Deltas or this or that the other or orderflow Footprints everything I do 90% of what I
36:31
do is price action first whatever I do after that is for trade execution
36:37
only but I have to get my context right and I won't always get it right okay I
36:42
sometimes can be over defensive sometimes I can be very aggressive but I'm just doing what I feel is right for
36:47
me in my portfolio you guys have to figure out what is right for your risk tolerance and whether it's life-changing
36:54
money or whether you're still in the early stages of your trading career or whether you're trying to accumulate more Bitcoin or whether you believe in the
37:00
long-term objective of Bitcoin and you want a hold spot for the next 10 years so you've just got to get the balance right between what is your trading
37:06
portfolio and what is your long-term Investment
37:15
Portfolio but yeah look like I said this looks brilliant I think there's no doubt in my mind that you know I'm not
37:20
concerned about anything I've been contextually bullish for the last several months I've been adamant and
37:27
openly clear about looking for Longs buying the Longs this isn't distributive I know there was comparisons being made
37:34
by various um voices that it's very similar to what we had in April May 2021
37:42
not really you know and and and thankfully the macro conditions have been favorable in terms of Bitcoin going
37:49
higher and so I I don't have any concerns
37:59
let's move on to ethereum
38:05
again what did I talk about when price I think Morin you remember this don't you
38:12
when Bitcoin uh sorry when ethereum was round about um here wasn't it what was the one thing that we said on stream
38:19
that is ethereum structurally when you look at this do you really think this is ready to take off and go higher no we
38:25
talked about the fact that really you want to see a Bas like environment okay before you see a shift
38:32
in context and continuation higher we got that formation we had a low a higher low another higher low
38:39
another higher low and again very similar to what I talked about a few moments
38:46
ago on Bitcoin in terms of bullish price bullish bullish bullish bullish price
38:54
action is structure we saw the bearish course come out
38:59
ethereum looks like [ __ ] when it was trading lower down but again subtle signs of price
39:08
action low significant high low series of
39:13
higher lows higher low another higher low very quick swing fail but respected
39:19
structure here into this demand Zone what was the need to go bearish the fact
39:25
that we had a a reclaim back above the midlevel after 3 months of price action
39:31
August September October and the first thing people think about oh [ __ ] let's let's turn bearish right into the mid
39:37
level when the majority of structure was respected and it was most likely
39:43
positioning or hedging into the elections right well whoever's positioned or hedged short must have to
39:50
be forced to close out their shorts and Longs piling in and that's why you get these aggressive moves to the upside people are now chasing the Trump trade
39:57
shorts are getting out their position so I think we will see a recalibration of price at some point maybe after
40:03
tomorrow's FMC things will become clear it into the weekend but again the way I'm looking at it I'm not you've had one
40:10
two three four five six tests of resistance at what point does
40:17
this give a shallow pullback before it takes off and my target on my ethereum spot buys is at least well let's I'm not
40:25
going to say at least objectively I'm looking for 3500 and after that we'll see but my entries have been from here
40:31
and here and here my average price is from like 22 20 I think it was 23s low
40:36
23s and if it pulls back I'm I'm happy with my positioning
40:41
but again when you look at this on the higher time frame zoom out look at the daily look at
40:48
the weekly we've had pretty much the perfect pullback in
40:57
into the previous range highs okay if this was the base
41:02
consolidation that we had for nearly 1 and a half two years this Zone here okay is your
41:11
range this is your wickoff shower strength if that's what you want to call it price rallies retest that range
41:19
there this was probably what some of the best buying opportunities one could ask
41:24
for in terms of positioning now to go back to these highs so in terms of a the range that
41:30
I'm looking to play on ethereum is very simple this is my Range High I'll do this in
41:36
blue and this is my significant range lows
41:41
here why are people getting bearish into support we've we rallied significantly
41:47
from 2,300 to nearly 4,000 we've had a 40 50% pullback get your ass out of the lower
41:54
time frames get your head out out of the lower time time frames and look at the big picture ahead of you in terms of
42:00
risk to reward and I say to this on the timeline in terms of the risk to reward ahead of you or ahead of us I'm looking
42:07
for Longs with a clear invalidation below 2,000 unless there's a swing fail
42:13
that occurred and price got back inside fine I'll take the loss I'll jump back in I'm looking for price to go uh to
42:19
continue higher so again I just don't understand why there's so much bearish bearish sentiment price takes time to
42:26
build these BAS like structures and the longer the base the bigger the base the more probability that we could see price
42:31
go continue uh continue higher so that's what I'm looking at and and again when you look at the uh the bands
42:41
here on the on the 3day we are starting to get that compression this is what I'd
42:48
like to see eventually I want to see the crossover and you know what happens when we get the crossover you you've got a
42:54
bare signal eventually you get a bull signal and you see that shifting momentum Trend or what I hope is Trend
42:59
to the upside at least into that 3500 level okay objective ideally would be 4,000 if you go to the uh the weekly I
43:07
think there's still a bit more work to be done on the weekly time frame it's not too bad but you can you can see that
43:13
the bands are starting to lose that trajectory to the downside still needs a little bit more work but
43:19
on the daily I think what you've got to be looking for for here remember what I talked about in the previous stream
43:24
where you get bull bear and then you're going to get the bll ball signal and if
43:30
the key thing to note is look at the time that we've been red
43:36
red shallow uh period of green or or short period of green
43:43
significant uh contextual of red or you know bearish sentiment not bearish sentiment I I should say bearish price
43:50
action according to the 12 and the 25 daily you finally get that shift into green shallow period of red slightly
43:57
longer period of green and this looks likely to be another shallow period of red the minute I see the bull signal I
44:04
think it's continuation higher okay into
44:09
3500 so this is the zone that I'm looking to play range lows 25th
44:16
percentile of the lows to the upper bounds 25th percentile of the upper bound with the
44:21
mid-range is that clear on on ethereum now if if I'm bullish on ethereum then
44:26
clearly have to be bullish in alt coins as well looking at total two and total
44:36
three let's go to the 3-day chart I generally like to use the 3-day chart because it really gives me a clear
44:41
picture of price again very similar story we've pull back into the yearly
44:48
open level there's a yearly open on total too buyers are stepping into the market
45:02
let me go to the 5day shot we're breaking above the uh trend
45:11
line or close to however you want to map it out this to me looks
45:17
like possible or probable reasoning for Trend continuation
45:22
higher I could be wrong but the way I've positioned is uh I I'm looking towards
45:27
Trend continuation higher when I look at the weekly
45:34
chart look at the stock there's room to go to the upside still on The Daily there's room to go to
45:41
the upside on the 3day doesn't give me much
45:49
but this is a is is a significant Trend down this is a significant Trend down
45:56
with redistribution continuation lower this has been a slow drift gradual bleed down and now we're
46:03
starting to see the rounding out of price from a structural perspective so again the main focus that I'm trying to
46:10
apply here is just look at the structure of price this isn't an aggressive trending down Market it's been it has
46:15
been a painful slow bleed for many I understand but at the same time it also presents great opportunity
46:22
on many altcoins to get exposure to the upside okay so that's total two and then
46:28
we can look at total three again when you look at total three we've got this
46:36
compression let me just get rid of the bands for a
46:46
minute so the way there's so many ways you can do this but look ultimately keeping it very very
46:52
simple compression under the mid level we've also got
46:57
compression in terms of this here so how many more pullbacks are we going to get
47:03
before this blast through at least into here and then this and then
47:09
this that's the direction that I'm looking to go in give me a higher high
47:14
higher low continuation
47:24
higher so again I don't really have any concerns I think we've been presented with some excellent buying opportunities
47:30
August September October um again as per the streams I've been advocating for the fact that we are
47:37
getting some really good setups on altcoins you want to start to think about positioning into altcoins I've
47:44
talked about on various streams how I position into spot positions and how I
47:50
trade perss of Futures and altcoins can anybody remember what I said
47:57
when I position into spot or when I position into into futures or
48:06
perss I position into spot prices okay or spot allocations when we make these
48:13
types of structural laws here right when you see this type of price action this is where I pick up
48:20
spot I'll hedge at the highs where I'm looking to play the momentum from a Futures perspective
48:27
is when you have price okay four stages of a market
48:40
cycle this is your distribution price trends
48:46
down you get your low you get your high you get your low it holds or it swing
48:52
fails gets back inside this is where I Look to buy Spot when Once the range has
48:57
been established pick price rallies pulls back at to spot price and it could take
49:04
two three 4 5 six months where I Look to position into Futures is when you
49:10
essentially have like I've called it in in previous uh streams the tail side of of
49:17
accumulation this is when I start playing pers when the momentum shifts
49:23
quickly to the upside you've got all this inefficiency here which which we haven't traded on the way back up yet
49:29
we've built the base if this is a bullish Market I want to start looking for Longs on the tail side these moves
49:36
are very very quick to the upside I've got my spot doing most of the leg work
49:41
and I'm looking to max out on Futures not Max leverage but go aggressive with
49:47
the flow and the momentum to the upside maximum amount of gains least amount of
49:52
time I'm in and I'm out matter of days matter of weeks two weeks I'm done
49:58
this is where I FL it on Futures okay and you can use the you can use the
50:05
bands on here as well to go with to go with that momentum if you look at this
50:10
we're on the daily time frame here are the bands screaming momentum to the
50:16
upside look at the trajectory of the Bands first of all we have been in a Range bound environment this is not a
50:23
trended market just yet what does a trended market look like like this is a
50:28
trending Market this is where I want to play leverage this is where I'm looking for continuation higher when I see these
50:34
aggressive flushes or shallow pullbacks I want to flow with a momentum I don't want to short this I want to only short
50:41
the market or get out the market when I see distribution tops like this look at the trajectory of the moving averages
50:47
the Mas have gone from aggressive trajectory gradient to the upside price is now
50:54
range bound this is where I stop playing leverage I start thinking about
50:59
positioning or taking profits I think about risk to the downside and I latch onto shorting to the downside
51:07
again and and and and I gave you an example if you look at this now this is still very choppy if you're playing
51:13
perss there's a good chance if if you're not [ __ ] hot at trading you'll have got chopped up
51:20
100% And then you look at altcoins like sui right where people are still trying to short this
51:27
what success have you had shorting this when you could simply use a simple strategy such as a 1225 EMA band to tell
51:34
you don't short all right if you want to if you had exposed you to this then fine
51:40
you could have you could have hedged at the highs here you've got a a good enough reason for a swing fail and get
51:45
back inside there's a consolidation under resistance and you get the breakdown fine you can hedge out your
51:50
position but again anybody who's short of this they've got to wipe the [ __ ] out in a matter of date in a matter of 2
51:57
days all this buildup of short positioning what happened one candle is all it
52:05
took is it distributive it can't be confirmed yet because whilst we are in a
52:12
Range okay and this is something that you should really pay attention to do you really think that price is going to
52:18
come all the way up here and then just come all the way back down like that unless it's an absolute shitcoin probably could do but in this
52:24
instance these are the types of environments that you want to identify is this a range and secondly what is the
52:33
overall Market context telling me is there a likelihood that this is distribution and the moving averages get
52:39
chopped up and if you lose structure then yes there's a good chance of shorten the market back down but in this
52:45
in in this instance is this all just compression okay where you get this clearance rust
52:51
type of pattern this is your clearance rust above here you're going to get a trend continuation higher
52:57
classic price action pattern that I've covered on streams before where you see the emergence of a clearance thrust same
53:02
on salana I've been talking about it for weeks and weeks and weeks on the timeline now is that when you look at salana let
53:09
me see if I can bring up another chart just to demonstrate the thought process if you
53:17
go to the weekly again higher time frame context or even the 3-day
53:28
there's every
53:33
possibility that this evolves okay into a clearance
53:38
thrust or whatever whatever you want to call it okay and whilst many were advocating for
53:45
distribution Sal is going to go back down to $70 $60 I've held my views on
53:52
this very strong that 120 was for buying okay re buying back into into
53:57
salana at this point I'm looking for if there is a pullback doesn't have to be I
54:04
think once we clear these highs it's it's going to be alltime highs this is a
54:10
very very good bullish continuation pattern building okay as long as structure
54:15
holds I'm looking for these highs to get taken out we'll see what happens after
54:23
that does that help
55:01
right just give me one second so you get this heavy buildup of
55:07
Base um let me just zoom zoom zoom heavy base buildup showing a resilient buyers
55:13
sellers on clean bottom or top with a large number of rejections
55:19
okay we've had some significant rejections at the highs but in terms of the
55:26
base Byers stepping into the market every single time okay it's not breaking
55:32
down it's not breaking structure we haven't had acceptance below 120 and then you get the clearance
55:39
thrust where sellers become exhausted you're going to get the continuation higher first objective is this and then
55:46
hopefully hopefully new alltime highs
55:58
price is fractal ignore the time frame but you kind of get the gist okay so you
56:03
have compression multiple touches of the trend
56:08
line and then you're going to get that continuation High I think those of you who used to watch my streams in 2020
56:14
2021 it's it's pretty much how we traded Luna from $30 to 110 and then we shorted
56:19
it on the way back down that was that was amazing that was some fun time fun times in uh Luna
56:33
what about Sol's inflation doesn't really matter I just look at the price I I honestly don't look at fundamentals or inflation talk to me about inflation on
56:39
the way back down in the bare market and I'll be your biggest fan but in a bull market it doesn't matter about Supply or
56:44
inflation it's all about the marginal buyer okay who's going to be look at Supply look at demand look at Price
56:50
action look at the context understand what you're looking at ahead of you forget you know the aspect of inflation
56:56
we're in a bull market it's until we're not in a bull market then I'll then I'll then I'll say yep tell me more about this inflation
57:03
metric and is is this thesis going to serve my shorts really well to the
57:12
downside let me just have a look at some of the questions here if there's any questions please do let me know in the
57:17
chat um now's your CH now's your chance and I'll probably wrap up the stream in about 10 15 20 minutes
57:31
yeah 2024 has been good I've been bullish you know uh openly throughout
57:36
2024 I've been looking for very good buying opportunities I've been very patient to re reposition into altcoins I
57:43
think there's some altcoin structures that I really like like w usct i I think I picked some up today at 20 21 22 cents
57:50
okay the last time I traded this was from 21 to just under 40 cents captured more or less a a 100% gain
57:58
almost hedged out uh and then just sacked off the position when I saw the
58:03
structure break uh and very I consider myself very fortunate to be buying back at these high time frame macro lows this
58:11
was August I couldn't ask for anything better you know even if it does Di back into let's just say 18 cents 19 cents
58:19
that's fairly good in for me very clear invalidation at these lows here so I'm thinking High time frame like in the
58:25
next month or two um probabilistic or how I'm looking to
58:31
play this is that if the markets are going to go higher then I think this goes to 45 cents it's a nice trade
58:37
okay it's not lifechanging but it's a good trade um other structures let me think
58:45
of I think this is a really good structure to look at so I talked about Zig um when you see price rounding out like
58:54
this tapping this demand Zone you get a good reaction off of it this has been range Bound for 6 seven
59:01
months and if you look at Goats I pretty much nailed this trade very happy with
59:07
my goat trade still in position it was um who remembers this I
59:12
think I shared it on the timeline as well before it even happened it was practically this I I I think I had
59:20
something like this this level here um price is about here and what I
59:28
had planned was to be buying in at that 20 cents 15 cents level this is what I
59:34
thought would happen I think it's from yeah if you go my timeline around about the uh 20th of
59:40
October this is what I H this is what I initially had cuz you get this like rounded
59:46
structure and it just Springs really hard and aggressive it's a beautiful structure to
59:52
observe and and watch for
1:00:02
it's happened on uh one of the coins that SC trades which is
1:00:07
fog
1:00:17
fwog and then you get that continuation higher all right um so again if I just
1:00:23
look at the other one which was um again just I'm I'm I'm talking about structure here I think we saw something similar
1:00:30
happen on this as well there you go so look at this you see price ignore the time
1:00:37
aspect just look at the structure that's all I want you to focus on is when you look at the structure here and you see
1:00:45
price come back clean out these lows here you get the aggressive move to the upside so that's gone from 15 to 28
1:00:53
cents nearly 30 cents probably more oh [ __ ] hell it has
1:00:59
yeah oops mind my language but I had the replay button on once it Springs it
1:01:04
really does take off not bad not bad at
1:01:11
all um let me look at to to was an interesting one so to was one that I got
1:01:17
wrong initially on to I had um what did I have
1:01:23
yes so this is what I had on Tower I shared this structure here that yeah I
1:01:28
remember doing this I want to see price come into this level and trade back up into here right I think I shared this on
1:01:34
it was right about the 24th or 25th right that for me was it this was
1:01:42
it I bought some tow here and I said that all right fine I'm not sure what happens next but I'm positioned here if
1:01:50
I get a red retest I'm looking to trade this into this level here and I don't think that happen let
1:01:56
me have a look I didn't get the long trigger to go
1:02:02
well I didn't get to a chance to add to my long and it fell short of my Target and then the market broke down okay so
1:02:08
now this is what I had on my own personal chart that right fine if we're going to break below here what's the
1:02:14
next objective demand Zone that I'm looking at it's this here and is this all going to be a
1:02:21
deviation under this level because if it is this is where I've got back in or
1:02:26
this is where I want to get back in above here or I can be
1:02:33
aggressive look to take a position here with a stop below here okay does that make sense position here once we get the
1:02:39
retest of this level and it holds pushes away I can start positioning here stop here anticipating that this is
1:02:46
all going to be deviation under this level and if he gets back inside I can add more first Target second Target and
1:02:54
then third target over here right so this is the context that I
1:03:00
think about ahead of time when I'm looking to execute the trade now that you've understand understood the thought
1:03:06
process from a simplistic point of view all right we're tagging the demand
1:03:13
Zone as long as this holds now I took a position over here okay when it starts
1:03:19
pushing away right we've pushed down held the
1:03:24
level I said stop below this low here held my stop it's still respecting the
1:03:32
level and I'm okay still not stopped out hypothetically in this instance I I let
1:03:39
the trade breathe I gave room for the trade to breathe because I'm only one third filled and I want to add to my
1:03:44
position at this point so I'm not I'm still not too concerned the fact that I haven't gone in full size okay helps me
1:03:51
have a little bit more conviction that I'm not just going to puke my position and get [ __ ] can out by this I didn't see acceptance below this level here I
1:03:59
saw a wick into it another Wick we swing fail this low here so at this point I'm thinking fine we've had two chances now
1:04:06
to break down this level it's the 5th of November and it was yesterday that I tweeted that altcoins have sold off
1:04:13
fairly significantly I'm looking at opportunity and I'm thinking about and and personally I'm thinking about
1:04:18
scaling in buying into altcoins again starts pushing up added to my
1:04:23
position this now look looks more again at this point let's just assume we don't
1:04:29
know what happens next at this point this looks now more akin to me that
1:04:34
there's a decent chance it hasn't confirmed I'm just trying to explain my thought process here that was this just
1:04:40
a shake out was this just a deviation below this level here and this was the demand Zone to
1:04:45
buy and what will give me that confirmation I've been executing for this what people teach you is wait for
1:04:52
the deviation then get back inside
1:04:58
I don't personally do that I I want to trade at the deviation I'm anticipating
1:05:03
this being a deviation as long as the lows are well as long as this low holds here I want to be aggressive
1:05:11
because there's my stop there's my entry okay and I'm look look at my risk reward
1:05:16
now all of a sudden as opposed to waiting for a bigger deviation then my risk to reward isn't as high I'm
1:05:22
probably playing the probability of being right but I want to be aggressive in this
1:05:29
nature there we go break back inside when it pops inside very rarely do you get the perfect pull back again but you
1:05:35
see continuation higher okay so that's kind of the thought process in a bullish Market
1:05:42
context you get the Deep pullback uh short live deviation uh this is
1:05:47
generally if because I've got a demand Zone here this is where I'm then looking to do business I was wrong here took the
1:05:53
loss repositioned here here let's go again okay so I managed to get 2/3 on my position on
1:06:04
this well I just explained like why it's difficult to get in on a retest what retest was there on the 1 hour you
1:06:11
literally have to be chasing price and sometimes it's about
1:06:16
understanding the context here look I'll show you something else that I could have done uh again this is about low time
1:06:22
frame execution that I'll cover in the uh the the the this the four-week session that I'll be running is that
1:06:29
despite the fact that I'm talking about the higher time frame here if I clean all this up let me show you what I
1:06:34
normally do on the lower time frame and this is how you can execute on the lower time frame if you understand the higher
1:06:40
time frame context you can look for opportunities for execution on the lower
1:06:45
time frame now can anybody guess what I'm going to show you next for those of you watch my streams over the years you
1:06:51
should understand what I'm going to touch upon next any ideas
1:06:57
anybody what would I do I I'm waiting for somebody to tell me in the audience what would I normally do in this
1:07:03
instance when I'm looking for trade execution three steps somebody tell me
1:07:10
where it is
1:07:20
please right you're all going to say oh because of this SFP
1:07:28
possibly possibly but not only yeah low time frame range now okay
1:07:35
right you've got the first part right low time frame range where is that range going to come from what's going to define the
1:07:51
range yeah but how where am I going to Mark the range out from I'm talking about low time frame
1:07:57
range right Zan High time frame High time frame narrative right crypto hero
1:08:02
yep the candle that caus the move okay right watch
1:08:09
this this what is this here what is this
1:08:21
here the fact that this failed to hold I talked about this being the next demand Zone the 4our demand Zone
1:08:28
okay now watch range
1:08:34
Low Range High where's my Range High this point here
1:08:42
okay when I go to the 1 hour chart just imagine you don't know what
1:08:48
time frame this is even on a 15minute chart let's just go across the line you don't know what time frame is
1:08:54
just imagine this this is a daily chart you'd be thinking yeah we've been here for about a good 20 30 days all right ignore the time
1:09:01
frame this is the range that I've defined
1:09:07
okay historical context taking the mid of this is where it's here
1:09:15
okay that's my mid
1:09:21
level that's my Range High and this is on a four our demand Zone this is how I
1:09:27
nail my entries and this is just pure price action on an altcoin with the context of
1:09:32
Bitcoin if this is my mid-range and I map out my range
1:09:38
Quarters on this 4-Hour demand Zone and try it back test it you you'll see how you can really refine your entries and
1:09:45
this is just half of what I do what I'm talking about today I'll go into much finer details on the U on the free
1:09:52
private sessions that I'm going to do for for the next in in December so look
1:09:58
contextually just like how I how I would normally play a range extremities okay range high range
1:10:06
low mid-range for Confluence I know I'm looking to execute the trade so in
1:10:11
theory if price is going to come down where am I looking to execute I'm looking to execute in the lower bound of
1:10:18
the range if price trades below it like this I'm out if it gets back inside I'm back
1:10:25
back in again if it's just a swing fail of a
1:10:30
previous low and it gets acceptance back inside I'm fine okay but the invalidation that I marked out on the 4
1:10:37
Hour was this low here so instantaneously this is one zone that
1:10:43
I'm looking to do my business in between 395 and that 405 Zone okay what I'd like
1:10:50
to see is price come into the level okay push away I don't mind another retest or under this back above get back Above
1:10:57
This mate my stops here this is where I've been scaling in pushes up again I'll add add some more so this whole
1:11:04
zone between 420 and and 395 is where I'm looking to do my
1:11:10
business let me just quickly bring it across the
1:11:23
line that's a 50 so we got some time to go yet all right we're getting close I'm
1:11:30
going to put on the replay tool at this
1:11:36
point at this point here okay let's talk about it trade
1:11:41
execution let me get rid of this and this and the second thing that I want to
1:11:46
do is if I just got my high time frame level okay this was the other this was
1:11:52
the other range that I had def finded so we'll just mark this as this Zone here okay it was blue price is coming into
1:12:00
this zone now you're looking at this all right we've we've taken out these lows here at this point I'm
1:12:05
thinking acceptance back above I can probably get in above this block okay if it trades here then I've got to look to
1:12:11
do business here I've got to take the loss at this point my entry was here I've taken the loss I'm looking to get
1:12:17
back in lower down is that much Clear before we talk about going into the final aspects of trade execution let's
1:12:24
now go on on to the 50-minute Chart normally I'd be looking at the 5 minute chart but for the sake of speeding
1:12:30
things up we'll just focus on the 50-minute chart let's run this
1:12:44
forward still neither here nor there okay now we're pushing in now I've got my alerts going enough because at this
1:12:51
point I've set an alert to give me notification when price trades under 430
1:12:56
now I want to get to my desk and start thinking if I'm away from it to start thinking about trade execution very
1:13:02
simple three zones this Trigger or this Trigger or this trigger okay one3 1/3 or
1:13:12
1/3 wherever 2/3 above above here if we've had something like this and back
1:13:19
inside or something like this shift in structure and again then allowed okay so
1:13:24
these two types of structures let's run It
1:13:44
Forward what do we get we're in the lower bound of the range between 390 and 410 I'm starting
1:13:51
to add my position here okay
1:13:56
back at the range highs it's going to be choppy it's not going to be easy you think you've nailed
1:14:02
the bottom but price could always come back down and take out this previous low
1:14:11
here now that we're holding above this mid uh Range High but we're still
1:14:20
below this level here so we're not out of the woods yet okay we're not out of the woods yet we're still contained
1:14:27
between this this point here and this resistance Zone here but I'm looking to build a position in the hope
1:14:34
that somewhere along the lines this forms a deviation okay that's my thought
1:14:40
process I'm looking to execute on the actual deviation with the fact that we've got a 4our demand Zone here below
1:14:46
there I'm [ __ ] I have to get out of the
1:14:52
market let's run it forward
1:14:59
no problem I'm not going to get shaken out I know where my invalidation is we've just taken out this swing glow
1:15:08
here let me get rid of the red uh the red squiggles right so I can explain my
1:15:13
thought process here when you look at Price just focus
1:15:20
on the uh the 4our uh demand Zone range that I've mapped out
1:15:28
with swing fail this we're back above the mid there's my Range High I now want to see this
1:15:36
structure hold okay I don't want to see it drift any lower this is resistance
1:15:42
here where that blue line is and this is the current local range low this is the
1:15:50
area that I want to do my business I want to see acceptance back above here it might push up Shallow pull back and
1:15:56
then go and take out these highs here okay or all this move down there's not
1:16:03
much resistance on the way up so at least push back up
1:16:08
into round about this Zone here okay that's what I'd be thinking if I see that I'm comfortable in my spot position
1:16:29
we've reclaimed the level if I'm right I wouldn't want to
1:16:36
see price now come all the way back down here again then I have to think about scrapping this idea why are we down here
1:16:42
are we going to deviate this low and then get back inside and I have to go again strike two okay this is strike one
1:16:47
this is strike two I have a three attempt rule on executing a trade but notice how tight my stops are and why I
1:16:53
can size up on the position position because my invalidation is here my entry was uh this one here and then the swing
1:17:01
fill of this second entry here and looking to add on the way
1:17:10
up there's the back tips of the previous Sr okay so again you probably if if you
1:17:16
did wait for the reclaim you want to see price pushing away and your trigger would be here your stop would have to be
1:17:22
somewhere down here your your target is obviously much higher
1:17:32
okay and that's all she wrote there you go into that first objective to take some profit at this level
1:17:38
here whatever happens after that we'll have to wait and see but that's how I've positioned upon taking a loss on Tower
1:17:46
my first initial trade that I had only to get back inside uh back into position
1:17:52
from a lower price point and looking for continu ation higher I hope that
1:17:59
helps range execution on the lower time frame using a 4our demand Zone and and looking to execute uh on a 5 minute
1:18:06
chart one minute chart or time based charts doesn't have to be uh non-time based charts I should say on how to
1:18:11
execute on the lower time frames that's how I do it essentially that's not even looking at anything like funding open
1:18:17
interest cvd orderflow footprint he Maps just pure Ro price action first
1:18:22
understand where I want to do business then I can look up uh Footprints then I can look at uh heat Maps just to see
1:18:28
limit order books where is theand stacked in the books to give me Confluence of where I can potentially step in and become a
1:18:39
buyer and the only way you going to improve is by screen time not by uh looking at open interest open interest
1:18:45
ain't going to tell you [ __ ] about where to execute your trade you can look at open interest once
1:18:50
you got a good graphs of price action and you see this [ __ ] Time and Time and Time again okay it's it's just you're
1:18:56
playing a game of probabilities just like I did okay I took on the long I thought I got away with it and I
1:19:03
got stopped out fine I'll I'll play it from lower down into a higher time frame
1:19:08
contextual level of guess what Sr okay previous
1:19:14
resistance previous support return resistance iting our support again pushing away
1:19:27
but but the key look I'll be honest with the key to good training is not being proficient at technical analysis of
1:19:34
price action yes it plays a big part but I've come to discover over the last
1:19:40
several years that the mindset plays a massive part in
1:19:46
your decision making do you have the ability to pull the trigger when it matters are you oversizing are you
1:19:53
undersizing are you now scared to take on a trade because your portfolio is down x% or
1:19:58
you've taken three losses in a row or are you now looking to Revenge trade because you've taken four losses in a row you had a 10K trading account you're
1:20:06
down to 6K you've lost 4k on the 4K 4K in a week on your 10K trading account
1:20:12
[ __ ] it let me go all in on this next trade I need to make my money back and now you've blown out this is you against yourself no
1:20:19
matter how good you are technically no matter how good your technical proficiency is that's just the honest
1:20:25
truth um and anybody can be a great chartist anybody can show you before and
1:20:31
after charts ultimately how much how much did you execute on that trade and did you stick to your trading
1:20:37
plan anybody can draw an arrow from A to B but you're lying to your soul your p&l
1:20:44
will tell you the truth of how you really are and how you perform and that's all that matters
1:20:57
and don't look for the perfect entry it's not you're never going to get the perfect entry you're never going to I I
1:21:03
no longer have this um entry technique where it's one size fits all like I'm
1:21:09
just that's it if I'm going to long this it's it's it's all one position I scale in one/ thir one/ thir one/ thir I've
1:21:14
just give an example of how I chip chip away at a position I give myself room to breathe because what I used to do in the
1:21:21
past was had price come to my level I would have been the ideal candidate that
1:21:27
this would have been me I'll literally show you what I would have done 3 four years ago right this would have been me here um
1:21:36
price okay come to this Sr
1:21:41
level all right comes here test it all right I'm going to step in here oh [ __ ] I'm offside I'm going to cut it it does
1:21:49
that I lacked the balls to go back in again whereas now I'm like okay fine 1/3
1:21:55
here swing fill get back above it could go low down I'll have to hit the loss but I've only got 2/3 position size if
1:22:01
it shows strength then fine I'll have the final third on the way up I'm now looking to play the probability of being
1:22:07
right I want to see acceptance above here great acceptance let's go this then
1:22:12
has to be the deviation from a demand Zone we're filled in this in efficiency to the
1:22:23
left and it's your position size which is my my language screwing with your
1:22:30
head because when you're trying to take on too much size you could you become very fidgety you become very uh
1:22:36
irrational you're very emotional you're looking to hesitate you're going to cut the trade the minute you're offside by a
1:22:42
few basis points because you're oversized you're not giving the trade the time it needs to breathe and
1:22:48
develop and equally if you don't have enough size on and price pushes away way right I bet
1:22:56
many of you have done this cuz I used to do this as well I've got some size on here pric is up here oh [ __ ] it let me
1:23:01
just whack in a really good size this is going to go higher now and before you know it price comes back and you've puked your position because you're in a
1:23:07
loss what when you had a very good trade entry here and a very good trade setup
1:23:12
what let you down was not your technical uh analysis it was your mindset and your emotion the fact that before you even
1:23:19
executed the trade you you you didn't even calculate what type of position size you're going to put on you didn't
1:23:25
calculate where your stop limit is you didn't calculate how much you're willing to lose I'm not making it up I've been
1:23:30
there I've been through that journey and I can tell you that there's a very good chance that many of you do that now how
1:23:36
many have you actually gone ahead before even executing a trade and
1:23:41
written down all right if price comes to this level I'm going to risk 2 3% of my
1:23:46
Capital I'm going to look for this uh position size this is going to be my notional value if I get stopped out I'm
1:23:52
comfortable losing 500 ,000 $2,000 on this trade or or
1:23:58
$20 have you gone through that thought process so that you are now you have now accepted the fact that if you're wrong
1:24:04
this is how much you're willing to lose and if you're wrong fine it's just part of the game it's about keeping your losses under control and when you win
1:24:11
you you win with conviction and you've win won with some decent exposure or size on the trade that it's going to be
1:24:17
worthwhile okay you don't have to have a high win rate a 33 40% win rate is more than good enough if you have phenomenal
1:24:24
phenomenal at managing your risk to the downside if you keep your losses tight and small you will eventually be
1:24:31
profitable in the long term the most difficult part about trading like I said is bringing the best version of yourself
1:24:38
to that desk every single day with this with with the with the same discipline with the same level of planning and
1:24:44
waiting for the trade to come to you when you start making impulsive decision and plan decisions that's where you're going to [ __ ] up you haven't even
1:24:50
thought about why you're going to take profit or even if price doesn't get to your Target have you thought about fact that all right if price falls short of
1:24:57
my target what's my next plan have you visualized what you going to do if price does a or C you are playing a game of
1:25:06
probabilities but we'll touch upon that on on in December on on the streams and I'm going to walk through some of my
1:25:12
trades the thought process the planning the trade life cycle from uh planning to execution to trade management and then
1:25:18
how I reset what that means in terms of the trade checklist what that means how
1:25:24
how I Journal my emotions and how I remove some of the emotional aspects of my trading nowadays I'm super calm at
1:25:31
the desk when I'm looking to execute it really doesn't phase me when I've got a winning trade I'm not I'm not euphoric
1:25:36
how often do you see me be be euphoric it's just part of the business you you become accustomed to it you you have to
1:25:43
have that emotional discipline just to be levelheaded at all times okay and
1:25:49
don't let the ego kick in yes we can all get it carried away with ship posting we can get car away we're trolling each
1:25:55
other but at the end of the day even that becomes tiresome and you know I used to do lot of [ __ ] posting in 2022
1:26:01
it was a bare Market I wanted to to prove a point maybe more to myself than to others and I kind of got carried away
1:26:07
and sometimes you have to take take a step back and ask yourself are you trading or is your ego trading for you
1:26:13
and the minute your ego starts taking over and you start making stupid bets with people publicly and start calling
1:26:19
others out for the mistakes or you start gloating well you need to keep your ego in check it's to celebrate your wins but
1:26:26
equally um remain humble about it because the market
1:26:31
will Che you up and spit you back out if you [ __ ] up so that's why I've always
1:26:37
said I don't mind missing trades but I don't want to be uh significantly losing
1:26:42
in trades because that's what hurts the most if you miss a trade don't worry there's plenty of Trades doesn't matter
1:26:48
there's always another trade but losing trades and losing big that's what's going to kill your account
1:26:56
all right okay so I'm going to wrap it up there um hopefully you found the educational more than anything let's
1:27:02
I'll quick look at what Bitcoin is doing all right not too bad it's still holding up there still a case that you
1:27:09
know you can't rule it out I I hope this trend continuation but with fomc look
1:27:14
what if we do get a shallow pullback again you know what if it's just this or
1:27:21
what if it's just lower down here what these are one of the two levels that I'm I'm I'm thinking about reactions prices
1:27:30
and if we do get a sh but what does that mean for altcoins are we going to get another opportunity to log altcoins again Upon A pullback we'll have to wait
1:27:37
and see okay but again when you look at certain altcoins that I've been in Ena look at that absolute absolute belter
1:27:45
over a daily candle literally has wiped out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 15 days
1:27:53
of selling in one candle that is what you want to see in a bull market these are signs the early signs of a bull
1:28:00
market okay this is very very encouraging so if
1:28:05
I'm seeing this on Ena and I'm seeing similar structures on say seven days nearly six seven days of
1:28:13
price action wiped out as long as this low holds I'm looking for continuation
1:28:18
higher
1:28:27
Nero did 50% did it I think Nero is one of the best coins you can trade in the market in terms of volatility [ __ ]
1:28:33
hell look at that that is phenomenal that is flipping good that is
1:28:40
really good that is very very clean very clean
1:28:46
price action yeah that's good that's very good
1:28:58
this would have been your previous range this is such a classical bull
1:29:04
pattern like in a bull market you see this on altcoins it's just beautiful to see it really is you're almost
1:29:11
anticipating the deviation and then what you can do is when you have this like when you have
1:29:17
this um this is a 4-Hour chart when you see consolidation like this for several hours right you can get ahead of
1:29:24
yourself and start mapping out a range like
1:29:29
this price comes down bounces there's your low there's your high this then
1:29:35
becomes your internal range that's a failure pattern swing fail of this that could have been your trigger here with
1:29:41
the stop at the lows and then what gives you confirmation is acceptance above here
1:29:47
there's your midrange sorry there's your mid-range okay so the
1:29:54
minute you see a swing fail gets back above you can execute stop at the lows you want to see the mid level hole you
1:30:00
don't mind price coming back in one two triple tap continuation higher shoulder
1:30:06
head shoulder on a lower time frame lovely lovely price action structure look at that doesn't [ __ ] around
1:30:12
straight back to the highs that's going to Rattle this and then it could potentially go into new
1:30:18
alltime highs T all right you know what [ __ ] it we'll still on stream a few more uh few more charts let's let's do it tier uh
1:30:25
I'm in tier I talked about it oh wow that's gone up a bit I think I tweeted that I'm back into tier at 475 again
1:30:32
look at this from a structural point of view um I could have asked for a better structure especially from an entry point
1:30:38
of view base base base base several months
1:30:45
probability rattle these highs and then go on higher into here that's all I'm looking for I'm happy if if I'm wrong on
1:30:52
this I would take this trade 10 out 10 times out of 10 okay I would happily take this type of structure this type of
1:30:59
trade over and over again because of the high
1:31:04
probability on the win rate on offer so my current entry I think is around about
1:31:10
460s the low was just at four or $380 I mean at 460 I'm looking for 12 if
1:31:17
I'm honest with you first objective sevens or eights but ideally I mean when you look at this inefficiency on the
1:31:23
downside and this is a base break above here this is where I'll
1:31:28
start leverage long into this level here quick fast move into here with my spot
1:31:34
position and I'll close up both trades into that mid level could it go higher yep if it goes higher then guess what
1:31:40
clean canvas I'm looking to trade this level here one level at a time okay I
1:31:46
the market isn't guaranteed the market doesn't owe me anything it could hit my objective right
1:31:53
of here but I'm am I going to get greedy and then before I know it price is all the way back down here and then it's
1:31:58
going to be [ __ ] I should have just taken profit too late you could have taken profit here you get a pull back price pushes
1:32:05
back above now you can get back in again with the with his stop below here what difference does it make you're only sacrificing this much of a gain at least
1:32:13
you've locked in your profits you're now playing the probability of being right that if there is Trend continuation hop
1:32:18
back in take profit that's just personally how I like to keep comp pound
1:32:24
in my account and keep growing the account okay um what else am I looking vanry cuz
1:32:30
somebody keeps asking for vanry it's I I'll be honest I've I've
1:32:35
still got a spot bag from two cents all the way from back in uh
1:32:41
December I did sell some partials uh but I still got a fairly decent amount I I
1:32:47
think I'm looking for at least 24 25 cents op is another one that I don't
1:32:53
have that I'm thinking about about oh look at that that's really coming up nicely in terms of Market Cycles I'm
1:32:58
really bunged up today man you know touch would have been really uh been great on the health front last
1:33:06
year I really suffered a lot and uh today is my first bloody um well this
1:33:11
week was the first time I've fallen n since February so I've had a good run but again Market Cycles
1:33:17
right base like structures Trend continuation up this is what I want to
1:33:23
play on the per side this is what I want to play short in the market I'm not
1:33:29
really too fussed about trading the distri distributive range it's very choppy if I am it's trading the extremes
1:33:36
okay same again extremes this is for perss where where I'm looking to play
1:33:41
Futures if you're not comfortable playing Futures you don't have to I don't recommend you do if you're in spot from low down just know way you need to
1:33:48
get out of the market okay you don't have to be like me it took me years to get to the level AR out and I've blown
1:33:54
plenty of plenty of accounts in my early days so it's not easy okay same again
1:33:59
base like structure is this going to be the push-up now into a trending Market at least into two $290 $3 from uh 150
1:34:08
that's that's a probably a probable 100% gain from current valuation so again with some sensible spot position and and
1:34:15
some patience this could be your mid of this range here you can start scaling in or well I
1:34:21
certainly will look to scaling and you're looking for the break out of the range into T1 take profit if it shows strength you
1:34:28
get a pullback continuation that's the reason to get back in look to play the second half of the range okay stop at
1:34:36
the lws execution trade Target
1:34:51
done yeah lemon and ginger is going to have to be the isn't it kind of good really I didn't want to
1:34:57
fall L at this point but it is what it is we get on with it it's it's only a shitty little cold um what else what
1:35:05
else op Tia sayi [Music]
1:35:11
W we've looked at nuro we've looked at eth we looked at BTC we've looked at total 2 total
1:35:18
3 p are because somebody keeps asking um
1:35:24
gaming yeah look I mean it's simple really if gaming
1:35:29
catches a bit then p p will catch a bid but until then I don't see any
1:35:35
strength Kai yeah let's look at Kai I I have a I have a bag of Kai um I bought
1:35:42
when Charlie tweeted down here looks good looks very very good Bas
1:35:48
like structure bottom of the range stuff looking for the mid $1 and then
1:35:54
potentially $2 but yeah looks good looks
1:35:59
good Jupiter yep I'm still in my Jupiter
1:36:04
position I think I shared it on the stream didn't I was it down here or somewhere over here when I shared it
1:36:10
again look at this remember when we talked about Jupiter being very familiar uh in
1:36:16
structure with whiff it reminds me of where whiff was several months ago so my
1:36:21
expectation for this look there's your low there's your higher low higher high
1:36:28
relevant to this higher low higher high higher low respect to the October monthly open
1:36:35
you want to see continuation higher and in fact that reminds me um if you go to EXO trading levels
1:36:42
don't forget to map out the the latest monthly open levels which is the November monthly open if we are
1:36:49
bullish we should have seen price trading below the November monthly
1:36:54
open and now you want to start seeing price push back above the November
1:36:59
monthly open
1:37:07
okay on uh Jupiter beautiful price action November monthly open sells off into the October
1:37:14
monthly open straight back above it this looks like Trend continuation higher if Bitcoin pulls back Mark this level out
1:37:23
you might get this or it might just go a little bit deeper back above there's your trigger to go along into that 130
1:37:29
level okay from $95 $1 that's what I'd be looking
1:37:35
at there was gito as well I think that was a good setup that's doing really
1:37:40
well okay beautiful beautiful setup lovely setup really is uh I talked
1:37:46
about the fact that be on the watchat for a pullback into this Zone here this is where you want to buy
1:37:56
I think we take out this we're above the both November and October monthly opens here and the and
1:38:04
the September monthly open so very very good price action within this range I
1:38:09
think crack this range this takes off to here and then eventually to the highs that's what i' be looking at we'll talk
1:38:15
about this once we clear this but from now it's from A to B that's it
1:38:24
Jito Jupiter what else is there
1:38:30
pith nice again Bas in structure above the monthly open first
1:38:37
objective for me was uh 50 cents and then we look at 70 lovely lovely structures really is
1:38:45
really excited to see these structures I just pray that they don't collapse or roll over uh and I think if they were
1:38:52
going to fail they should have failed by now had when Bitcoin was breaking down right but these are very very
1:39:02
encouraging AI memes uh what's a good AI
1:39:09
meme yeah I'm pretty bunged up guys I'm going to I'm going to wrap it up I'm really struggling to talk at this point
1:39:14
sounds like I've got a bloody Peg on my nose can't even bloody breathe so um I think we'll wrap you up pal yeah I mean
1:39:21
pal I mean that's one I've been partnered with since last year but pal looks good to me I I still hold a fairly
1:39:28
decent position in pal I'm looking for 50 60 cents at least then we'll talk
1:39:33
about higher
1:39:40
prices there's a chart isn't there that I've missed off today which is uh eth
1:39:47
BTC my question on E b2c is this and I don't know the answer I don't don't know
1:39:53
the answer to
1:40:00
this the question I'm asking is this and and I hope somebody can help me
1:40:08
here is this the base for eth BTC and do we tag it do we touch
1:40:16
it and if Bitcoin is going to go higher and Bitcoin dominance
1:40:21
Rises then that would give me me reason to believe that this has one more pushed down into here and at that point there's
1:40:28
got to be a reversal surely from we've literally retraced the entirety of this 2021
1:40:36
inefficiency on the left hand side and you will see these structures on many
1:40:41
many charts on the lower time frame and you get these violent
1:40:47
reactions from this level here so over the next 6 weeks
1:40:53
I think this will lead to an aggressive bounce or I hope it does I think with that you will see an
1:41:01
acceleration in altcoins in ethereum if that
1:41:06
happens so I just don't know if if if Bitcoin is is likely to go
1:41:12
higher then is e BTC has it got one last leg
1:41:19
lower before we see that reversal possibly okay what I look at the daily
1:41:24
I'm conflicted because we have two levels on The Daily
1:41:30
in fact let me just look at the monthly
1:42:01
all right so we're at the 786 that's on the monthly we've got this monthly demand Zone
1:42:10
here right let's just call that M and we
1:42:16
have the weekly and this is where I'm struggling
1:42:23
slightly because we've that's the monthly the weekly block or the weekly demand zone is this here this this down
1:42:31
candle and we haven't quite tagged it just yet but then when you go on the daily you have two zones
1:42:38
here you have this Zone here and then you've got this cluster over
1:42:46
here so the question is which one of these two is is likely to give a reaction and I honestly couldn't tell
1:42:52
you I really don't know but if Bitcoin is to like if
1:42:58
Bitcoin is to go higher significantly then does that mean e BTC drops one leg down and then we get the
1:43:04
reaction back
1:43:10
up you look at the RSI on uh ethereum
1:43:17
ebtc you've got a case for a very subtle
1:43:23
I don't know whether you can call this a bullish
1:43:29
Divergence possibly when you look at the stock
1:43:38
RSI on the weekly it's at the lows you got the RSI at the lows you've got the
1:43:49
macd needs a bit more work or some
1:43:58
musat needs a bit more work so are we going to see a reversal in the next several weeks I don't
1:44:06
know I mean I'd like to think so not not case if I don't know I I think there's a decent probability that we will it's
1:44:13
just a question of how aggressive is Bitcoin going to be over the coming weeks if it is going to go higher okay
1:44:21
so and I think this will very bullish for the overall uh alt Market um because
1:44:27
if you consider where Bitcoin is Right Bitcoin is at alltime highs right but
1:44:34
yet total three is nowhere near it si and Ne is total 2 but I really like what
1:44:41
I see I really like what I see on total
1:44:46
2 and total three so it's looking good it's looking very
1:44:52
very incorrect encourageing um and if there is for whatever reason one more pullback for whatever
1:44:59
reason then I'd be looking for something like this but maybe this is enough where
1:45:04
we get the trajectory
1:45:10
higher um I think we are trading above the bands that's on the weekly this is
1:45:15
very very encouraging so recall what I said uh at the start of the stream with
1:45:21
regards to bitcoin um
1:45:26
look at the wick here and then look at the bands were we're back above the bands the minute
1:45:34
this flips green they should take off back to the high okay the momentum will be there and you can front run that
1:45:40
Cascade of the ball signal if you just drop down to the 5day Chart when you look at the 5day it's
1:45:49
um it's compressing so on the 3day I wonder if it's already Crossing in
1:45:55
3day yeah it has yeah okay looks good very encouraging very very encouraging
1:46:02
all right folks that's it I'm going to leave it at that today I hope you've enjoyed the stream uh thank you for tuning in and I wish you all a
1:46:09
