0:10
chat that you can hear my voice okay and you can see my screen and we shall proceed happy New Year everybody hope
0:18
you're well no doubt many of you have had a very uh Pleasant time with family and
0:25
loved ones over the festive period and uh
0:31
certainly I think we're for a good year ahead of trading certainly but uh just
0:38
taking each day as it comes you know I'm not going to make any predictions but we'll we'll talk we'll touch upon that
0:43
in today's stream all right brilliant so again once as always thank you for
0:49
tuning in all the regulars I appreciate you very much and your support over the years just want to kick off with a very
0:56
special thank you to OK exchange for sponsoring the streams uh who I've
1:01
partnered with as a product partner so I get to test their um software and their trading and give them feedback and if
1:07
there's anything that you'd like me to recommend to them then please do reach out to me and as always uh anything said
1:14
in today's video is not Financial advice just give me a quick final check that
1:20
the audio is clear and we'll kick off today's stream
1:35
all right now there's a few of you who have been asking me about the uh the private group I was going to do for for
1:41
four three four weeks I am still going ahead with that uh just bear with me there's just been a few delays I'm just
1:47
working on uh a couple of things on the website if I'm honest with him just repairing some material so it's taken me
1:53
slightly longer than anticipated but nevertheless you know I I think we we
1:59
will go live when it's probably at some point towards the end of January if I'm
2:04
being honest unfortunately I was hoping to launch this week but uh these things
2:09
happen so not to worry it's free anyway so you know we'll we'll we'll come to uh that point in the next week or two once
2:16
I'm ready to go live and we we'll talk about that more in depth but let's talk about the charts
2:23
so what do we think is is there a cap on the no there's not a cap it's just
2:28
basically in a not what it will be is um I probably won't be as active on Twitter
2:34
uh instead I want to be more focused and dedicated uh with regards to trading it
2:40
just gives everybody an insight as to how I go about planning my week how I go
2:46
about journaling um how I map out the market so you know it's just basically
2:51
real time the things that I'm doing in the mornings What I'm Looking For What type of trade setups what the reasoning
2:57
is it's not a paid group it's more just a perspective of trading from from from
3:03
how I trade and how I journal and uh the mistakes that I make and how I learn from those mistakes what I do well uh
3:10
what are some of the structures that I use we'll touch upon uh facets of my journal we'll touch upon how I manage or
3:16
Journal my emotions you know so it's just uh an Insight really into how I or
3:22
what my processes are and trading is a process at the end at the end of the day um and you know like I said I've never
3:28
charged anybody any money I don't run any paid groups you know I do have a referral link but that's in partnership
3:33
with my exchange sponsors generally I just give away that money to charity and it'll be the same in this instance so
3:39
the only precondition is that you do sign up with the referral link but like I said all procedes I'm going to give
3:44
probably give it all the way to charity and I will be giving some uh prizes away just because I feel like I I can do and
3:51
that's up to me but anyway let less of that we'll talk about the uh the charts today so what do we think Bitcoin um the
4:01
first question I'm going to ask is are we going to see continuation or
4:08
are we starting to see the phases of distribution now when I say distribution I'm talking about a 3 month time
4:23
Horizon what do we think
4:32
not sure if you caught the last question but um I mean for for me what's interesting
4:39
is looking at the higher time frame chart you know you've got to look at the fact that Bitcoin has had a Relentless
4:45
move up from the lows we've reaccumulated here into this second leg
4:50
up now as I've stated previously I'm not
4:56
too concerned and the reason why I asked this because I I I see a lot of um opinions flying around on
5:04
the timeline that you know this is distributive that we've probably got a few months left and then there's the
5:11
other side of the crowd that's telling you that Bitcoin is going to go to $280,000 by the end of the year
5:17
everybody's entitled to their opinions there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and if you have a belief that you
5:23
know Bitcoin will inevitably go higher as an investor then I'm sure we're all going to be better off for that right
5:29
but the point is there's no there's no real
5:35
actionable item or plan that you can take from saying that at the end of the
5:41
year I think Bitcoin is going to be 180k what if it isn't what if on the flip side those who think that we've only got
5:49
a few months left the top is in we've been we've seen people calling the top all of last last summer last Autumn last
5:56
December well November November time December time and eventually Bitcoin breaks out you know so the key thing is
6:03
is just be objective you know people are entitled to to their opinions you don't have to have an argument just have a
6:09
rational understanding of markets and and ultimately for me look it's it's uh the way I'm I'm treating this is just
6:15
using a very very high time frame macro range it's evidently clear we've got a very clearly defined
6:21
mid-level I've used a raise uh range extension to to kind of give myself some
6:28
level of projection or you know where I think Bitcoin could potentially head but it doesn't has to or it could do and it
6:34
could uh exceed my expectations and go significantly higher but does it matter no it doesn't what matters is how I
6:42
action my trades what decisions am I taking right now or which decisions am I
6:47
looking to take over the next week over the next few weeks that's all that matters to me I'm not in this game to
6:54
play predictions and Chase clout you know I could say Bitcoin is going to go to2 200 ,000 I'm sure it's going to go
7:00
down very very well but it doesn't tell me anything it doesn't tell you anything it doesn't tell anybody who's looking to
7:06
trade the market on on how to position for that setup and and and that's what I'm looking at the market here is that
7:14
the first thing and and the reason why I'm probably going on off a tangent here is I don't draw these lines as
7:21
targets ultimately I'm looking at price as inv validation points inflection
7:26
points areas that I can do business what's the overall context telling me we are in a bullish Market structure okay
7:34
yes this could very easily right at some point develop into a a phase of
7:40
distribution but until that happens I'm not too concerned okay we
7:45
could see another rally up like I said another pullback a third drive up and then before before you know we get a
7:50
pull back down that could obviously happen but is that actionable right now
7:56
no it isn't okay so there's no point in me drawing [ __ ] on the chart like this yes it's good to have in the back of my
8:02
mind that this scenario may play out I already know where I'm going to action should it play out it's going to be
8:08
shorting this or just covering this right but it's not it's not there yet so all that matters to me is what's
8:14
happening at this current time okay that's that's the main focus for me and
8:21
and the what what I've essentially done here is just try to keep it very very simple using these key High time frame
8:26
pivotal levels now if you watch the previous three we mapped out the trade setup which came to fruition I talked
8:33
about price trading into that 90 91 92k level I wasn't sure exactly exactly
8:40
which swing point is going to be the uh the trigger point but it was very very close in fact it did take out the lows
8:46
that I marked out on the previous stream which I'll cover in today's stream now without further Ado let's look at the moving averages to begin with I think
8:54
when you look at this when you look at the bands part of my system tells me that I don't want to be a great
8:59
aggressively short in the market once we have reclaimed the bounds okay as a Trader trading levels fine but I want
9:07
one thing I'm trying to improve on is just sticking with the context I don't have to be in every
9:13
trade I don't always have to be looking for shorts okay last year
9:18
alone I had I think it was just looking at my journal 88 of my trades 88% of my
9:24
trades were Longs 12% were shorts okay on bitcoin that is so that that tells
9:29
you where I was in terms of 2024 2023 was slightly difficult for me you know I
9:36
didn't get the bottom right but I'm not here to catch the bottom I'm here to manage my risk and me managing my risk
9:43
was short getting out of the market shorting it all the way down yes I could have done a better job but ultimately
9:49
where I take um some satisfaction is actually having made more money trading
9:56
in this range than I would have just holding Bitcoin and the same happened here as well we were in this period for
10:03
the best part of 6 seven months okay and there was ample opportunities and and we shared many many long setups on the
10:10
streams at these key inflection points looking for those moves back into 70k
10:15
several times and they were very very profitable trade so when price is in a rangeb environment I'm not thinking
10:22
about price is going to go 200k I'm thinking about trading this and this
10:27
until it's in a trend okay now that we've had the trend up you know I'm still holding my spot from 54k I have no
10:34
reason to get out of my spot position just yet simply because of the fact that when I look at Price when I look at the
10:41
locality of price we are still within rangeb environment and if you recall what I
10:46
mentioned on the previous stream just looking at high time frame context we talked about this this kind
10:53
of rule of four or five weeks let me just take off the trend scanner we had this rally one 2 3 weeks
11:01
of Correction look at the Wicks okay this is your demand Zone clearly defined here then you get the push
11:08
up possible pullback and then continuation higher the big question is
11:15
are we in this environment okay or are we in something
11:20
more like this and the only way to understand is just observation looking
11:28
at what price is doing if it's going to break out into a trend it's going to be fairly aggressive if it's going to be fairly range bound and
11:35
choppy then you just need to be slightly sharp stay sharp stay alert to possible
11:40
downside risk okay now looking at this one two three and then the fourth fifth weeks we saw the the continuation
11:48
higher where are we now so we had the rally up we've had one two 3 weeks took
11:55
out the previous lows so if you look at this we've printed the low of the year I believe well give or
12:03
take okay on the 30th of December 31st we took out these laws now if you remember on last week's stream do you
12:10
recall the range that I mapped out okay the range for execution was this
12:18
here now I I went over this in in in fine detail as to how to execute this
12:24
trade what to look for and how I use these order blocks to to essentially
12:30
uh let me just do this in Green in fact I should have it on another
12:40
chart okay so what we had last week was I if you recall when price came down I
12:46
did talk about the fact that look price could rally over here I don't want to get chopped up I want to see price come
12:52
down either take this low this low or this low okay one of these lows I'm
12:58
expecting price to get taken Okay and like I said from from from defining a
13:03
range within where I want to do my business there's my Range High we've got
13:08
my range low and that would have been my mid one of these three would have been my my trigger points okay and I clearly
13:16
remember the scenario that I gave you it's going to be one of three scenarios that I'm looking for a trigger either we're going to come down and trade um
13:23
let me show you either we're going to come down and trade
13:30
into this back above that's a trigger to long or we take out this into the mid
13:36
level back above trigger to go long or third scenario take out the lows all
13:42
this into here back inside that's the trigger to go along okay sometimes you
13:47
just have to watch and observe and react to price now the reason why I marked out
13:54
this zone is if you remember the heat maps that I shared I did talk about the fact
13:59
around that 90 91 92 89k level there's a lot of demand
14:05
there's a lot of bids resting in the books what you want to see is aggressive
14:11
selling into those lows which we got you can see Market selling off shorts trying
14:17
to push lower down shorts opening at this level which is a criminal offense in my
14:23
opinion okay and eventually what did price do takes out the lows okay now
14:29
interested in doing business I talked about avoiding the chop over the coming weeks we've now taken a significant low
14:37
one two 3 stop under the mid or stop at the range lows targeting uh stop under
14:43
the range lows targeting back it back into the
14:49
mid okay that's essentially what we've got now the the point I want to make
14:55
here is that so far when you look at the weekly chart It's been a very very very very good reaction as far as I'm
15:01
concerned um when you look at this and and the
15:09
comparisons that I've made to this I think we'll soon find out over the next two 3 weeks
15:16
very very quickly whether this is going to be continuation higher or are we just
15:22
going to remain range Bound for the foreseeable future just as we did here
15:27
surprise 1 2 three drives aggressive selloff into this demand Zone price
15:33
rallies swiftly back towards the range highs and it remains rotational and
15:39
range bound within this context if that happens then I think we're in an
15:45
environment where alts will kind of fluctuate you'll get
15:50
these days when alts rally you'll get days as Bitcoin comes off the highs or comes off the mid levels altcoins will
15:56
decline 10 15 20% okay so so so in terms of it being an outright alt season
16:03
collectively across the board I don't particularly subscribe to the idea but I
16:08
hope it does happen Okay so you can see how I'm saying I don't subscribe to a
16:13
market wide alt season simply because of the fact that we have dispersion but what I am open to is that okay there's
16:20
going to be days when we see 20 30 40 50% moves on altcoins any pullbacks on B
16:26
on bitcoin will lead to a pullback Well we'd like to well assume we get a
16:32
pullback on altcoins okay for 10 20 30% Corrections and then we get under 3040 50% rally so I still think it is going
16:39
to be very very difficult for many people to navigate these markets from a trading perspective uh for those who are looking
16:45
to hold and and hit a jackpot that that's fine as well I mean you're not guaranteed anything but I I do believe
16:52
that this Market of all Market cycles that I've traded is probably one of the
16:57
most challenging from an altcoin persp perspective just because of the liquidity aspects you know the books are
17:02
very very thin altcoins are whipping around moving around we've seen absolutely [ __ ] coins uh going from not
17:09
you know 1 million market cap to 100 to two 3 400 in a matter of day days or weeks so it it's a very unique Market
17:17
but let's not distract from from distract from the point that look one two three drives pull back one two three
17:23
drives pull back into that demand zone are we in this environment
17:29
or are we in this environment here okay we'll soon find
17:35
out now my question to you is what do you guys think do you think we are likely to remain range Bound for the
17:42
next six seven weeks or do you believe that we we will see Trend continuation
17:47
higher
18:03
when do I press the buy button um yeah there are some rules um and I'm going to talk about this in the private group
18:10
because it needs a good few hours to explain uh some of my execution
18:15
strategies in further detail unfortunately it's going to be too out of context for this stream I
18:22
just want to keep this short
18:29
okay so some of you are leaning towards Trend continuation higher some of others are leaning towards rangeb environment I
18:35
honestly don't know that's that's the honest truth I don't know and and that's fine as a Trader it's not about thinking
18:43
that we're in Trend continuation it's not about thinking that we're going to be range one it's about where can I do my business so I am
18:51
currently still holding my spot position I didn't take the long simply because of the fact that I was away from my uh
18:58
machine on the 30th of December I had no intention of trading this had I got this setup in the first week of January then
19:05
fair enough you know this week then I would have taken the long setup but I'm I'm relatively comfortable I I
19:11
maintained my Bitcoin um spot exposure now the next point is uh if we look at
19:18
the moving averages if you look at the daily you can see what's happened
19:24
here the bands this is the 12 and the 21 we've reclaim back above the bands with
19:30
expansion and it's holding it's not just a shortlived deviation into a supply Zone it is holding above the mid U the
19:37
mid-range okay of this local range now obviously the most logical
19:45
explanation is that look as long as we we see 97s hold so any pullbacks now
19:52
into this level here
19:58
and continuation higher is is going to be a good opportunity to long this
20:04
looking for the range highs okay so that's kind of the setup that I'd be looking for or
20:10
alternatively we may just get a corrective move into this
20:17
uh range quarter and if you look at where the yearly open
20:24
is round about 93 okay so a pullback wouldn't surprise me a pull back into 93
20:30
would not surprise me at this point if we do happen to get it and one of the reasons I say that is because when we
20:36
look at the uh the stock RSI we are oscillating at the highs but
20:43
this has been a fairly decent move up now it's just a question of does this remain hovering at the highs Bitcoin
20:50
gives a shallow pullback and it goes for these highs here before we get a pullback I don't know okay if it does
20:57
then I won't particularly be chasing the Longs I'd much rather chase the momentum on alt coins okay however
21:05
if for whatever reason over the next several days Bitcoin decides
21:12
to print something like this we got a candle here we got another candle
21:20
here okay and then we got a candle back down
21:25
again and it rotates and oscillates back below the mid-range rejection on the
21:31
underside and before you know it we we get a pull back down into here okay that
21:37
scenario for me is a pull back into this Zone
21:42
here at that point I'd be looking for potentially considering Longs there's two zones it's either going to be off
21:48
the early open so anything below it short lift
21:53
back above is a trigger for me to go long looking for the range highs again I do believe at some point with will trade
21:59
into this over the uh coming weeks that's all essentially that's what I'm looking for whether that's going to
22:05
happen now or whether that's with a pullback and going higher I just have to wait for my trade setup
22:12
okay is that clear but everything we discussed on the previous stream about
22:17
execution and looking for Longs that this is not the time to short the market you want to be looking for long trades
22:24
here that came to fruition very very nicely
22:31
what I'm also thinking is that one of two scenarios if Bitcoin remains range bound
22:40
over the next several weeks does that give altcoins and
22:46
ethereum room to breathe and look for the rotational trade where Capital
22:52
really starts flowing into ethereum into altcoins whilst Bitcoin remains range
22:58
bound it's possible we have seen that happen before as well in previous Cycles
23:05
alternatively does Bitcoin continue with the trend scenario
23:11
going higher and do altcoins latch onto that momentum and trade higher as well
23:16
okay so there's two scenarios that I'm that I'm looking for are we going to be rotational or are we likely to see Trend
23:23
continuation still too early for me to to to U take a hasard to guess as to
23:29
which one it is all I'm concerned with like I said is just the extremities pric is at the mid are we going to get a
23:35
pullback if so I'll be entertaining long opportunities if not my expectation is
23:41
then should we get a shallow pullback continuation higher I'm looking for continuation on my altcoins and they
23:48
probably looking to start you know taking some profits off my altcoins because I want to pay myself okay that's
23:53
that's the reality
23:59
let's just have a look at the uh so just just to summarize on bitcoin um like I
24:04
said I I stated on the the last stream of the year on the 22nd that we're not
24:10
going to break down from here I very much Su suspect at the very least we get a range B environment best case scenario
24:17
is this type of scenario where we see Trend continuation higher okay and we
24:23
just have to see we'll just have to wait and see what we get now where where I'll just just as a pointer thinking further
24:31
ahead that what if this is a phase of distribution what you will see
24:41
is the 12 and the 25 losing its
24:46
momentum when you see this and price is oscillating to the highs and back to the
24:51
lows and back to the highs you've got to stay sharp okay because now the the possibility of this being
24:59
Trend continuation obviously has been reduced significantly because the momentum is
25:06
dissipating and you have to now appreciate that the context where you
25:11
may be hoping for a trending environment has now shifted to a range B environment and this is where people try to Long
25:18
these areas get frustrated get stopped out lose a [ __ ] ton of money okay price
25:23
bounces back up start longing at the highs lose money okay
25:29
the only inflection points where you want to be looking for Longs in my opinion is and and and it is what we
25:35
covered is is essentially at the extremities of the range of the range lows okay that's what I'd be very very
25:42
comfortable in looking for Longs and equally should we take the highs and and
25:47
it does trade back inside then that for me is a reason to hedge okay I'm not outright short but I'm just looking to
25:54
preserve and protect the gains that I've made from here to here okay but for now
26:00
I I expect somewhat of a rotational environment over the coming
26:09
weeks but key thing to know is is just be observant of the 12 and the 25 when they slow down in momentum momentum
26:17
dissipates then you've got to have your wits about you because you don't know at that point is this
26:23
reaccumulation before we see one final pushup higher into 131 40 or
26:30
is this likely to be the the Hallmarks
26:37
of a Distributive up thrust after distribution that's your first drive
26:43
second Drive third drive and then you get the corrective moved down in several months time I don't know I don't know
26:49
but the the the reason I talk about this and this is where people perceive oh EXO's being bearish again it's not about
26:56
being bearish the reality is I'm not not going to you know pedal hopium and pump
27:01
some air up your ass and tell you Bitcoin is going to go to 200k you know fist pump I'm sorry but at the end of
27:06
the day this game is about survival and you want to lock in your profits when you start seeing risk in the market or
27:12
there's a risk of scenario okay so it's just about being observant and like I said this isn't actionable this is not
27:18
me calling for a three drives distribution top it this is me just explaining to you that of a probable
27:25
scenario that we in this instance are you looking to get out of the market and why okay it's not about oh look I I I
27:32
charted this three months ago and a call the top but I'm still [ __ ] holding my Bitcoin spot and I'm down 50% doesn't
27:38
mean anything it's what you're looking to action at the time and this [ __ ] that I've just drawn on the chart is not
27:44
actionable it's irrelevant but it's just a scenario that you should have in the back of you man like what if this plays
27:50
out what am I looking for so you're not being reactive you're being proactive to
27:56
the situation of price structure okay it's about understanding price structures and where and why and how
28:03
you're looking to do business okay so but like I said you know for for
28:09
q1 I'm still very optimistic uh I think we still have a good several weeks of
28:16
decent price action I think there's going to be opportunities in the market still from a long perspective with some
28:21
patience all right right let's look at the stocks uh the stock RSI on the weekly
28:28
now who remembers what I said about the weekly dipping down and and rotating
28:34
back up what does that mean if that happens does anybody
28:40
remember that what I said was that if we see the weekly oscillating to the
28:46
lows then for me it confirms that we're likely to be more range bound okay where
28:53
we'll see something like this okay the alternate scenario
28:58
that I talked about was the fact that well let me just get rid of the trend
29:04
scanner was this scenario here we if you remember I clearly explained this you
29:09
get this a rally in price okay drives up
29:18
one consolidation two into these laws look at the RSI rolling over but what
29:24
does it do crosses back up and what does price do Trend continuation higher okay so if
29:31
we see the RSI rotate or gravitate back towards the highs and this is the
29:38
pullback essentially then the expectation has to be that we we're
29:43
likely to see train continuation as opposed to a range bind environment
29:48
should the RSI stock RSI oscillate to the lows okay that's how I'm thinking about momentum indicators in this
29:55
instance is that clear so just another subtle sign to watch out
30:02
for to give some sort of confirmation towards the the the contextual aspects
30:08
of
30:21
price but for now this I've seen these structures play up it's it's now a a waiting game
30:31
okay you can see where the majority of price has traded it's been between 90
30:39
91,000 okay and that $200,000 level so if we do now over the
30:48
coming week or so come back inside this level then I I would be looking for
30:55
possibly this Zone here this was the move up pullback retest off this of this
31:01
demand Zone here before we saw continuation higher so if we do get a pullback this is a zone that I talked
31:08
about is where I'm looking to do business or potentially look for a long or is it that we're going to get one
31:14
more push down okay we take out all these lows here aggressive short start
31:19
piling in down here these get caught offside price then rips higher and do
31:25
something like this okay that's the alternate scenario scario that I'm looking for should it set up now looking
31:31
at the heat map you can see over on bitcoin
31:37
Futures that I've marked out the range lws
31:43
there's that demand Zone that I've been talking about okay and there's the highs now you can
31:49
see there there's quite some Supply at 103 104 105 106 so that there's a fairly
31:56
decent amount of Supply here with broken through this level pushed up higher into another set of stacked asks okay and you
32:03
can see that price is being propped up here with with some uh bids resting at 101 100 but really if we do break down
32:11
where's the next major level of good uh section of blocks waiting in the books
32:17
it's round about that 990,000 level which is round about here again so again if over the coming weeks we are range
32:23
bound and we're not just in Trend continuation then I suspect that we will eventually come back down to possibly
32:30
take out these lows into this level here after that that's another long opportunity why because my invalidation
32:37
is is likely to be somewhere here okay so is this a case now where we're just going to chop grind rotate spit people
32:43
out chew them up spit them back out again chew them up more again and rinse
32:48
their money before we see a significant move higher or we see a significant move lower that's why in this environment I
32:55
only prefer to to focus on the extreme ex rities because I I have a very very high hit rate and all I'm looking for is
33:02
trap Traders traders who long the highs they get trapped they puke I short the market Traders short the bottom they get
33:08
trapped they unwind their positions I ride the momentum higher again okay so just two extremities keeping it very
33:15
very simple not really looking for short-term trades around the uh the mid level it's just far too choppy for my
33:22
liking I don't great if you're a day trader great if you're a scalper I'm not a scalper I'm not a day trader I'm more
33:29
of a high time frame Trader where I Look to work around these key inflection
33:34
points why because they give me the best reactions and they give me the best risk reward setups same at this this point as
33:40
well here as well okay so something around here something around here is where I'll pay interest everything else
33:46
I've got patience I can wait weeks for my setup and when I do get my setup I often nail it okay
34:00
so does this scenario play out I gave you two long possible long
34:06
scenarios and again this isn't about oh you you've given so many scenarios are you going to come back and claim CL I
34:11
couldn't give a flying [ __ ] I'll be honest with you it's more about understanding where I want to do my
34:17
business and why and what do I need to see ideally the ideal scenario the type
34:23
of Longs that I love to take is when you see lws like this being completely taken
34:29
out and then price reclaims back inside clear inv validation trap Traders Delta unwind price back into the mid take some
34:36
profit off you probably get a pullback and then go to the range highs okay that's my favorite setup the the the
34:42
least favorite is when you get a pullback into a demand Zone because here
34:47
you're kind of scratching and you're hoping this holds but this is where your risk management comes into play because
34:53
if you do bid this level and it breaks down accept it it's part of the game you're playing the prob ility there's
34:58
nothing wrong in attempting a trade which looked like a logical setup in
35:04
your strategy and you've got a clear invalidation Point that's fine take the small loss move on there's another setup
35:11
around the corner which you can take which you probably will do uh which you will inevitably nail
35:17
okay it's it's about having a plan not not being reactive at the chart because all look bitcoin's broken out I'm going
35:22
to chase this this isn't part of my strategy this isn't part of my plan just because you see this C here I haven't
35:28
checked the data is this shorts just getting liquidated shorts closing out which is fuel price higher and now we could see a
35:35
lack of momentum and therefore we could see a slow drift back down again into this Zone over the next week we'll have
35:42
to wait and see all right so I'm just trying to explain how I think about price how I think about you know
35:48
understanding what price is telling me the levels it's the levels I'm looking to trade now the question is would I
35:55
short this could I short this yes I could but as I've explained I'm T I'm trying to
36:01
take less trades this year as I have done in 2024 which 2024 was arguably my
36:07
best trading performance here okay uh I nailed a hell of a lot uh you know I
36:13
shared a lot on the streams nailed a hell of a lot very very fortunate like I said that um you know my strategies
36:19
worked the conditions were Prime and this is what you have to understand right when I talk about strategy
36:27
you can create a strategy and it doesn't work what's the
36:34
issue so the question is you can create a very very good strategy or your friend gives you a very good strategy but it
36:40
doesn't work for you what's the issue the issue is understanding the
36:47
environment when to apply that strategy okay it's not a [ __ ] strategy there's
36:53
nothing wrong with it it's you you're the problem because you're not executing it in the right environment
36:58
so that's why you have to have a couple of strategies for different contextual environments and like I said strategy
37:04
isn't isn't about oh here's a trading plan I'm going to take this trade and that's it I I have a good six seven pages in my
37:11
journal on just trade execution alone so within my trading strategy I have
37:19
several strategies as Sub sub strategies or sub modules as to how I execute my
37:24
trades what I'm looking for what I need to to see and
37:39
why so yeah like I said I'm not surprised to see this reaction the very very happy with W with Bitcoin pushing
37:46
away from here we just have to see we we'll have to wait and see what we get over the coming days I really hope this
37:51
is Trend continuation um but we we'll touch upon that later this week on another stream
37:58
or probably next week I should say right let's move on if there's any more questions let me know but um I want to
38:04
move on very quickly through through some of the other charts we'll have a look at eth
38:10
usdt again I think this is fine if we get the pullback on bitcoin
38:16
what do you think is going to happen ethereum it's going to give you another opportunity to potentially long the
38:23
market okay we are in a rangeb environment this is not a trending
38:28
environment look at Price here for the best part from from March 2024 through to
38:36
December 2 um 16th of December you know so basically for for nine months we've
38:43
been in this rangeb environment it's a rotational rangeb environment and should we be present I'm
38:51
already long e but should we be presented with another opportunity where
38:57
price okay if you assume assume this is a Range High there's a range lows okay Range High there's our range lows here
39:05
okay you can take the mid of
39:14
that should we trade okay this is how I'm thinking about it
39:20
now should we trade back below I think we come back
39:27
and clean up these lows here back into this demand zone for another long setup looking for
39:35
price to go higher okay and that inevitably gives you I'm I'm not really a a head and shoulders guy okay but it
39:41
does give you the the shoulder the inverse head the shoulder and the right
39:46
shoulder before we see continuation high so what I'm saying is don't be surprised if for the next few weeks we still
39:53
continue seeing chop uh rotation and then in February hopefully in February
39:58
we see that momentum and continuation higher and again when you look at the stock RSI when you look at the uh the daily
40:05
the daily is oscillating at the highs here again the question is if this rolls over fairly quickly then that will be uh
40:12
evidenced by Price rolling over okay so price is the dictating Factor uh if
40:17
price rolls over the the daily stock RSI rolls over and that's where again as I
40:22
did here look for the execution of Longs look into long from ad man Zone okay
40:29
when we look at the uh the uh 3day that's quite
40:35
interesting it's at the lows here okay so this could continue just oscillating
40:41
at the lows here slightly longer okay and and if the daily does roll over and
40:46
this day is like this then then that adds further Confluence for me that I want to be looking for Longs again from
40:52
this Zone okay I will take profit if we get below 35s uh I'm long from this um I
40:59
can't remember 3,000 whatever level it was so I will be looking to cut I've got my stop just below 34 3470 so I'm happy
41:07
to to get stopped out and lock in the games knowing that there's a decent decent chance right this is how I this
41:13
is how I manage my risk this is a a classic example of being in position from
41:19
3,100 price is now trading above 3,500 This Is My invalidation Level you
41:26
could say well you could say well XA what if it just comes in and stops you and then goes
41:31
higher what do you think my answer is going to be you think I'm just going to do you think I'm just going to sit there
41:37
and think [ __ ] I've been stopped out I already know in my mind what I'm going to do if that happens okay it's very
41:42
simple for me I've got two inflection points that I'm looking at I'm currently
41:48
long if the market wants to go higher great if the market pulls back fine I'll get stopped out I lock in the gains from
41:54
here to here price stops me out I I've got two choices I can now either watch and wait PR for price to trade back into
42:02
this Zone okay into here look for another long
42:08
continuation higher invalidation at the lows if it breaks below fine let it
42:14
trade the range lows one 2 3 and finally it's com back taking these
42:20
lows if aggressive shorts are opening down here and I see that on the order FL on the footprints reclaims back back
42:28
above this key swing low over here just give me a second let me just tid up the
42:33
chart reclaims back above this key swing level that's a trigger to go along stop at the lows at that key macro mid level
42:41
looking for price to trade back into 39 so you're taking a trade from 28 29 3,000 back into almost 4,000 that's a
42:48
fairly good trade you can get a you can easily chalk off a two three R trade there if you wish to do so okay or you
42:54
can pick up a spot look to trade it for $1,000 do move higher so the the point
42:59
is you know if price does come back and stop me out and this is all we get fine
43:06
show me a reclaim back above here and it holds there's my demand Zone then
43:11
there's the block that I need to see hold I'll just chase price looking for higher continuation at least taking out
43:18
these highs and I've said that look the next time price revisits the highs okay
43:23
uh I think there's a fairly good chance we break through it and trade trade all this
43:29
inefficiency to the left hand side okay so I hope that gives you understanding on risk management where I'd look where
43:36
I'd look to cut the trade it's not about a 1 hour or 4H hour candle close if I'm
43:42
going to cut the trade I have my reasons to cut the trade and I'm looking to get back into position again I've locked in
43:47
the gains okay you could you could also argue X or why don't you hedge from here yeah I I could hedge but looking at
43:54
Price you know why do I want to be pissing Against the Wind if it rolls over fine I I I I I can at least hope
44:02
that this holds a support then we get the continuation higher okay so again if
44:08
again you want to see this block hold if we get that pull back into here reclaim back above I will long into these highs
44:14
and higher okay uh alternatively I'll just be very fortunate to long from lower down again having locked in the
44:20
gains that's what I'm thinking about and this is purely trading no I'm not talking about doing this with your spot
44:26
book I'm purely talking about how I think about managing risk how I think about taking profits uh inv validation
44:33
levels reasons to get back into the trade okay where are the zones that I want to focus
44:46
on when you look at the weekly again this is why I don't believe we are
44:52
likely to just break out yet if as I explained with Bitcoin if
44:57
this oscillates to the lows over the coming weeks for the remainder of January then I think we we're just
45:03
building a base before we could potentially go higher again okay if I'm wrong I'm wrong below here
45:11
then we [ __ ] that's all there is to it really unless it's shortlived but then we'll have to wait and
45:17
see we'll discuss this when we when we come to that point okay I'll happily flip my bias very very quickly
45:44
looks bearish doesn't it when you look at this you'd be thinking H could
45:49
possibly take out these lows here right if I'm longing this where would I be longing this I'd be thinking yeah give
45:56
me a retest into here then I'll probably look to long this so therefore if this is a pullback in a
46:04
bearish market structure you've got lows lower low lower
46:10
high lower low down into here that's what I'd be thinking yeah sometimes it's nice just
46:16
to look at the charts Inver but there you
46:24
go eth BTC I do feel this is the beginning of what
46:32
I hope is a bottom on ethereum it may take a bit longer but I think once this
46:38
moves it moves so I would not be looking to short e BTC at all it's it's been a
46:45
slow bed down and I I suspect at some point or or I should say I hope at some
46:51
point we got something like this one candle and then two candles and then a
46:58
third candle back into this Supply Zone and this could happen in a matter of weeks 3
47:05
weeks is is all it could take to wipe out months and months and months of
47:10
selling one two three candles so that's why I think the the opportunity
47:17
favors being long on ethereum upon the
47:25
pullbacks and it is a sh coin I agree it's a dino coin but you never know look
47:30
at xrp when it moves it moves right so when that does happen we shall see
47:36
but this is certainly not the area that you want to be uh bearish it's it's it's
47:41
common I mean you'd look at this would you get bullish into resistance no you wouldn't right and if you were looking
47:47
to short this Market let's just assume hypothetically we've we've seen an extensive rally you're looking for a
47:54
short the ideal short would have been push this take this out back down into
48:01
here there's a trade done okay so that's why I say some point I do expect this to
48:07
uh revert back into this uh into this Zone
48:17
here hey Magus hope you're well brother all right so again being bearish
48:23
here is makes no sense we're into the man Zone I feel as though we're starting
48:29
to base out so inevitably at some point you would wish to see like I said a fast
48:35
Relentless move to the upside could happen in February could happen in March hopefully happens at some point in q1
48:41
let's have a look at Bitcoin dominance again not something that I trade but
48:48
it's just something that I observe and it gives me further conviction to hold Al so if we see the
48:57
pullback on bitcoin or we see Bitcoin rallying higher you know uh I I'm looking for altcoins to illustrate and
49:03
demonstrate strength so far we we we had we had a nice move with the Trump rally we saw
49:09
some of those gains being given back uh we've had another nice rally of the yearly open but I I still suspect it's
49:15
going to be very choppy for the next week or two uh but hopefully we get resolvement in February where we see a
49:21
move uh continuing glower down okay so that's all there is on bitcoin dominance we quickly hover on to the totals as
49:28
well total two again doesn't surprise me we we tagged the level that I've talked
49:34
about that we're looking for price now to trade within this range here uh we talked about buying opportunities that
49:41
if price comes back into this Zone here this is where you want to see alts react that's essentially what we got off the
49:46
yearly open this is the zone that I I still believe that we will continue
49:52
playing whether we get a pullback on altcoins now if Bitcoin rolls over back into the yearly open 92s 93s remains to
49:59
be seen but again very clear um pivotal point we're at this mid of this region
50:06
okay so where price found support pushed up into a level of resistance if it rolls over then you're going to get a
50:12
pullback on altcoins and you should be looking for long setups again on altcoins I believe in into the uh into
50:19
the latter parts of January heading into February inevitably I do believe at some point and this is just my belief loosely
50:25
held opinion I'm looking for price to potentially trade higher into this Zone
50:30
here okay 4 q1 until eventually we get a pullback something like this all right
50:36
total
50:41
three again not too different uh you can see I've already got my scribbles from the previous
50:47
stream I talked about the fact that you want to see this Zone hold here it it it is doing it is holding expect slightly
50:54
more rotational um price action if it is if if it is rotational um then yeah
51:02
again keeping it very very simple I'm not looking to show altcoins I'm just looking for opportunities on pullbacks
51:09
looking for Longs and then continuation higher okay that's what I'd be looking for again here and again when you look
51:15
at the uh stock RSI on the total 3 it's everything Bitcoin is doing okay
51:22
so if this does oscillate over the next week or two to the lows then you have to expect altcoins to give
51:29
that pullback all right I've already explained what the immediate bullish continuation scenarios I don't like to
51:35
use the word bullish but Trend continuation but you've got to be aware of the downside risk and with downside
51:43
scenarios comes buying opportunities um you know for what hopefully should set up to to give you
51:48
some very good trade setups all right so just something to be cognizant of and again when you look at the daily the daily we've had a fairly decent move off
51:55
the yearly open um so again any if I just clear the chart here's kind of what I'm thinking
52:02
are we likely to see one more leg down in terms of consolidation where you have the the the
52:09
classic structure and then you're going to get the trend line break break of the trend line over the coming weeks whether
52:16
it's here whether it's somewhere here this is essentially uh where I feel from a
52:22
structural point of view if we do get that mve down back above here that's the cue to to go back to the highs okay so
52:27
just just be open to the fact that we may oscillate back down into this demand
52:33
Zone here across you know which will be reflected on many altcoins not every altcoin but many altcoins obviously meme
52:40
coins have their own uh mind share and do their own [ __ ] like butth hole but uh you kind of get the gist that's that's
52:46
that's why I think I just feel as though we need slightly a little bit more a few more weeks of consolidation before we
52:51
start seeing a continuous price action in in February hopefully okay man is the same one other so I'm just going to wrap
52:59
up here I I was going to cover some altcoins I'm very sorry I'm just running out of time um I believe that over the
53:05
next week or two it's just going to be continuation of chop and grind I'm not sure if Bitcoin is ready to break out
53:12
just yet I hope it does and I hope altcoins continue rallying higher and I've explained my case for that but as
53:21
always you just have to be aware of the fact that there may still be one more
53:26
corrective move down that's the consolidation uh that we'd like to see
53:32
before we start thinking right that's a Breaking the trend line now it's time to go higher attack these highs here and
53:38
make new alltime highs and then we'll see what happens after that okay I think that's it really for me
53:45
just a very nice gentle uh stream for the start of the year just High time frame charts expectation is continuous
53:52
rotation until we get structural buildup uh these do these do take time you know
53:59
people assume we're rallying and it's time to go to new alltime highes and before you know there's a pullback
54:05
everybody starts well not everybody but people start [ __ ] their pants that's it alt season's cancelled and this is
54:11
bearish and then before you know everybody's [ __ ] their pants at these laws where
54:17
objectively you should be thinking about buying opportunities until proven otherwise and again when you look at the
54:23
12 and the 25 I've got no concerns okay across every
54:29
single indicator where I'm concerned and I'm just going to wrap up on this is
54:34
when you see phases like this okay where you've got dissipation of the moving averages
54:41
we are clearly in a Range B environment we've tested the low several times but
54:46
there's just no momentum sellers are the dominant players in the market we get a breaking
54:53
structure then it's time to shift context so if you go through every chart you go through Bitcoin am I concerned very simply
55:01
looking at the moving averages no okay nothing to be concerned about
55:08
just yet but if this does start developing into a range and it starts showing signs of weakness over the
55:14
coming weeks then I will be paying far more attention to possible downside
55:20
scenarios okay to manage risk same on E usdt any concerns no 1225 on uh on the
55:28
weekly absolutely fine retest of the Bands that's why I said look don't be
55:33
surprised if there is another retest of this Zone here and then you get continuation higher okay so that's kind
55:40
of what I'm looking for until we lose this key pivotal level of that 28 Zone
55:46
below 28 that is a very major structural shift and I would be very very very very
55:55
cautious at that point but until then I'm I'm absolutely fine we'll quickly wrap up on total
56:01
2 again nothing to be concerned about just yet it's still fairly early days to
56:08
be even considering or calling a top I'm I'm not sure what the obsession is or why people are are trying to call Top
56:13
over the next few weeks there's no prizes for it okay if you think the tops in sell everything [ __ ] off simple as
56:19
that if you're looking for buying opportunities buy the dips look look to trade price higher until you've been
56:25
given a CLI inv validation that look below this level there's a problem okay
56:31
below this level then there is a problem but until then range highs range lows
56:38
there's my mid-range I'm fine the bands are above the mid-range I'm fine above here I'm looking for pullbacks into this
56:44
until the context shifts that's all okay that's all wishing you a great week
56:50
ahead we'll cover uh more in-depth trade setups I'm just going to see how the market players are and if I like some
56:55
setups that I'm seeing on on the market right now I'm not there's not really particularly anything that I'm seeing we've had a fairly decent rally off the
57:01
early open but you know I don't want to be talking about shorts at this stage because in in these contextual
57:07
environments as we've seen today where price traded into that 100K level all it
57:12
took was one candle shorts got their [ __ ] ass handed to them and uh price cascaded higher so really when you see
57:19
any form of selloff in this contextual environment I'm looking for Longs until I have a reason to start looking for
57:24
shorts all right but that's solarist I'll probably catch you on the weekend we may do a macro session on the on
57:30
Sunday uh I may look to bring on a guest uh just to give us a view of what their thoughts are for q1 from a macro
57:37
perspective I think that's really going to be interesting there's there's all sorts of talks about the TGA being run down and there's a a possible liquidity
57:44
injection coming into the market there's obviously the inauguration we've got non-farm payrolls coming later this week
57:50
uh so there's all sorts of uh events but I I do I do remain optimistic that I
57:55
think at some point in February we we will hopefully see uh altcoins continue
58:00
