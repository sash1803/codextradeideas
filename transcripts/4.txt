all right we should be
0:17
live welcome back to another weekly live stream it's Trader XO here once again
0:22
it's the 14th of October 2024 and the time is 9900 p.m. in the UK
0:29
or 8 PM UTC if you can just give me a quick confirmation in the chat that you can hear me okay and you can see my
0:36
screen will kick off today's session very
0:55
shortly all right excellent so as always today's stream is it's uh sponsored by
1:03
OK exchange who I am a product partner with and a special thank you to the team
1:08
at OK exchange for sponsoring these weekly streams as always anything said in today's video is not Financial advice
1:16
it is just my view of the market and without further Ado let's kick off the Stream So I think what
1:23
we'll do in today's stream is keep it relatively simple I think the first thing that I'd like to focus on is is
1:30
context in terms of Market trade context and looking at the overall environment
1:36
we'll take a look at Bitcoin on the high time frame we'll drop on drop down onto the lower time frame we'll review total
1:43
2 total three ethereum and we'll probably go over a couple of altcoins as well in terms of
1:48
setups so first things first the Bitcoin chart if we just move on to the monthly
1:56
I'm just going to jump straight into this okay if you Rec call what I said in the
2:01
previous stream I think going back 10 days or 12 days right what do You observe or what do you
2:08
notice with the Wicks okay that was one of the first um key pointers that I
2:16
highlighted on the monthly chart now when you look at historical
2:21
context on any chart for that matter when you see a series of high time frame
2:26
Wicks at Key demand zon it's often
2:31
probable that you will get a reversal from that point same happened at the highs here okay so you can see how price
2:39
often reverses from these inflection points now again when you look at what
2:45
we've had over the last three four months in July August and
2:51
September fairly significant works okay buyers are stepping into the market sellers unable to push price lower down
2:58
all right so that's a very very very positive sign but it needs confirmation the second point is that in
3:06
terms of the monthly open okay we've had price trade below the monthly open it's
3:12
now above that particular level they're the two key pointers for
3:19
me in terms of the chart not only that but we are also both the September
3:25
monthly open and the October monthly open so for me in terms of high time frame cont textual levels of support I
3:31
do want to see this 63 63.5k level hold as support now moving
3:39
forward let's drop down onto the weekly now in terms of the
3:46
weekly looking at the chart again taking the previous candle body high of
3:52
2021 you can see that price is very close enough to find an acceptance above
3:57
that level okay that Point number two uh in terms of the weekly chart what I also
4:03
want to mention and and again I'm just looking at the contextual aspects first just what stands out to me the
4:09
most is when you look at the yearly chart so again yearly lows and we've also got the
4:18
yearly highs okay what's the one thing that I've said time and time again on
4:24
stream and on the timeline is that there's no reason or concern
4:30
for me in terms of Bitcoin to the downside for as long as price respects
4:35
the yearly mid level now when you drop down to the Daily time frame chart this was the key demand Zone that I focus on
4:42
that I've highlighted in the past that every time price has traded in or around
4:48
this level it's been very very shortlived buyers have been very quick to step into the
4:54
market so again I'm I'm not going to elaborate on the point of you know
4:59
calling for 80k or 40K I've said it time and time again if people want to do that let them do that all that I'm concerned
5:06
about is what is the chart telling me right now and where I want to do business
5:12
okay for as long as we're above the yearly midlevel I don't have any concerns that we're likely to trade
5:19
significantly lower down if that happens we'll revisit that scenario as and when
5:24
that develops but for now I think from a contextual perspective from a contextual bias perspective Ive I've I've
5:31
highlighted in the previous stream how just because of the fact that we are making lower lows and lower highs okay
5:40
isn't necessarily bearish because you have to understand the overall
5:45
structural composite of price this is not a trending
5:50
environment generally when you have a break of Market structure followed by a
5:56
trend that's when you see acceleration to the down downside we touched upon this on the previous stream
6:02
okay you get the breaking Market structure you get a lower high lower low price is not going to waste any time in
6:07
accelerating to the downside or to the upside in this
6:12
instance as highlighted on the previous stream it's just for me still within a range bound environment between that 53
6:19
54 to 70k level and I also made a point of reference right that how
6:27
many again I'm not calling any yeah but how many um individuals have stated that
6:33
this is bearish Market structure we also covered the fact that well if we
6:38
consider if this is assumed or perceived to be bar bearish Market structure which I disagree with I've held my uh views
6:46
that I'm still looking for higher prices okay in terms of Market
6:51
structure when we had a top in Bitcoin in 2021
6:59
again when price finally established a rangeb environment you had a low a
7:07
higher high a higher low equal highs another high low another high high is
7:13
this deemed to be bullish all of a sudden yet price breaks down continue
7:19
the trend continuation is lower so again looking at this from a contextual perspective right for all the bear
7:26
posting and doom posting out there I I just don't see it personally uh at this moment in time and again when you look
7:32
at this this is more of a corrective consolidation redistributive
7:38
structure as opposed to again we are getting lower lows and
7:43
lower Highs but again I I deem this to be a signs of reaccumulation until
7:49
proven otherwise all right so just think about the contextual structure on you'll
7:54
see many tweets about Bitcoin still printing lower highs and lower lows on and so so forth but I think in the grand
8:01
scheme of things you just got to treat this as a consolidation structure until price resolves one side or the the
8:08
outside of the range then we can for certain know that we've got a possible direction of continuation lower or
8:14
higher but for now you've got to trade the r for war it's
8:19
worth is that clear okay now what we're going to do next is move on to the moving
8:25
averages in terms of context
8:37
so another thing that's very encouraging to see is what did we talk about in terms
8:44
of the 12 and the 25 weekly EMES the bands are still
8:53
bullish they have managed to reclaim back above the 12 and the 25s that's
8:59
that's essentially what I spoke about in the previous stream that as long as any as long as price trades below the bands
9:06
but not too far away and it remains compressed under the bands there's every
9:13
possibility that we could see price reclaim back above retest into the bands and then you've got to go with that continuation higher we made a reference
9:21
to SPX or E uh es where in a previous
9:28
example we had on the weekly time frame price lose the bands didn't trade
9:36
significantly away from the bands it was very very shortlived a matter of 1 2 3 4
9:42
weeks reclaims back above structure is respected the context is still intact
9:48
the context is to the upside and we saw that continuation higher in terms of price so again when you look at Bitcoin
9:55
here we had one to 3 weeks below the an trades back above it and holds that
10:01
level this is why again in line with the monthly open I think that this level of
10:08
62 63 is the key level for me where I do not want to see acceptance below that 63k level from this point onwards okay
10:15
otherwise I think that all that tells me if we are to trade back below the bounds is that we will see further continuation
10:22
in terms of range bound price action as opposed to continuation higher all right is that clear so far in terms of the
10:29
high time frame
10:37
context so looking at the high time frame context I think there's nothing
10:43
for me to be concerned of I'm still looking to be aggressive in the markets
10:48
when there are buying opportunities we are at a level of resistance here and I think any pullbacks now into 62 or the
10:56
monthly open will present an opportunity to take some Longs okay that's what I'm
11:01
looking for in terms of my spot positioning I'm already in spot from uh
11:07
50 I think it was 57s or 56s from down here so I'm just talking
11:14
about from a trade perspective an overall contextual perspective I'm not
11:19
seeing the bearish case at the moment now let's have a look at some oscillators on the higher time
11:25
frame when you look at the weekly again I alluded to the fact that when the
11:31
weekly oscillators have been trading at the lows here and price is just in
11:38
somewhat of a corrective Channel or range that's generally a sign of
11:43
strength in the market for
11:51
me and I also lud to the fact that when you see price or the RSI oscillating at
11:58
the lows it's generally not a good time to short the market or look look for shorts when
12:06
the oscillators are heavily oversold you want to be instead looking at the context of price and looking for those
12:12
buying opportunities where in essence we're looking for continuation higher okay that's pretty much been the context
12:19
I still think we're going to get that move higher over the coming weeks when
12:24
you look at previous structures on Bitcoin in terms of Corrections and cons consolidations and
12:31
continuation what do we have okay classic example is price in a Range
12:36
takes out the lows continuation higher we saw that again in at the start of
12:42
this year trades are in the range you get the spring below pushup continuation higher and I think once again we covered
12:49
this in the Stream spring below into this key daily or weekly demand zone of
12:56
50k closes back inside uh retest that significant key level again and now
13:01
we're starting to get that push away higher so you've really got to ask yourself is if price C break down we've
13:08
seen the the Wicks we've looked at the moving averages or the EMAs we've looked at the weekly stock RSI is this really a
13:16
market that you want to be shorting or fading aggressively to the downside as
13:21
opposed to looking for very good buying opportunities when you see fear or and emotions on the timeline okay that's
13:28
pretty much being the context that's everything that I've alluded to over the last several weeks throughout the
13:34
streams let see what's happening hope you're well any questions around that and we'll
13:41
we'll drop down onto the lower time frames but when you look at this it looks fairly fairly good to me I do not
13:46
have any concerns I my expect expect expectations are this certainly does go back to the highs
14:03
right in terms of market in terms of the market um what we covered last week now
14:09
if you if you go back to the previous stream if anybody did care to watch it or did uh watch the replays uh we shared
14:17
the trade setups and there was one key level that I highlighted and it was this as a key
14:22
inflection point the point was that for as long as price okay I don't mind a retesting to
14:30
this level as it's often presented a very good buying opportunity I went into
14:36
depth about the trade setup on the previous stream when you look at Price the inflection points off this level
14:42
have been very very good capping price to the downside but
14:47
again this daily demand zone is essentially what I wanted price tags that level takes out the previous lows
14:53
that was a trigger for me to essentially look for continuation in Longs we caught the long uh the previous week or
14:59
whenever it was from 60k to to 64s it got back under the monthly open that's
15:04
when I head short on the timeline as well looking for price to take out these lows to get back into position reclaim
15:11
above the level and now we're looking for this to trade back into the highs which we have okay now the question is
15:18
if 66k is the resistance level then what am I looking for in terms of pullbacks
15:24
assuming that I'm not into position then for me it's it's a matter of well where is the month L open first of all we know
15:30
that the monthly open is resting at that level of around about 63.4 63.5 let's go into the daily time frame
15:38
let's just map out the high time frame range we've got our range highs we've got our significant range lows we are
15:45
above the mid level and I think when you look at price and number of attempts it's had to break
15:53
below um the yearly midlevel one two three attempts and it's failed from July
16:00
August September and the fact that we've left
16:06
okay a bunch of lower highs I think these are prime to get taken out I really do I think any pullbacks into
16:12
that monthly open level if should that happen I'm not counting on it but if it should set up any deviation below it or
16:20
whether it's just into that level I'm looking for continuation Longs and I do believe at some point these highs will
16:26
get rattled okay that's essentially what I'm looking for invalidation is very very clear for me it's going to be at
16:32
this key mid level here okay below 60k and then I think there is course of concern to the downside okay because
16:38
we've had one two three attempts at the lows okay but in terms of local market
16:46
structure we have shifted contexts as far as I'm concerned when you look at
16:54
Price such that there's our significant low we've
17:00
printed a high higher low higher high another higher low I'm looking for that
17:05
continuation of bullish Market structure within this larger range it's still
17:12
within a range Okay and like I said we probably won get a clear definitive Trend until we find price trading above
17:19
73 74k uh and until that that happens okay
17:24
I'm just looking to play those rotational trades on bitcoin
17:30
skewed more to the long side as opposed to the short side but maintaining my spot exposure and should price trade the
17:37
highs okay over the coming weeks take out these highs and should it get back inside then that is a a classic
17:45
example or scenario to where I would then start hedging my short I start
17:51
hedging my spot explosion with some shorts okay so that's the the defensive scenario in the event that we do run the
17:59
highs get back inside I'm going to lock in the gains that I've bought on spot by hedging with a short around this region
18:05
here until it can price can prove to me that I want to continue higher then I will remove the shorts and let price
18:11
trade higher 75 80 85k whatever is right so in terms
18:19
of trade setups I'm not sure what that is going to look like I've just closed
18:24
out my long from 68k into uh 6 66 just below 66 so I'm just waiting to
18:32
see how price develops here but ultimately I think the better opportunities are on altcoins we've seen
18:38
some significant moves on altcoins and that's kind of where my focus has been for the last few
18:44
weeks but overall just to summarize I think things are looking very very good on bitcoin or or at least very very
18:51
promising where my expectations for now is that as long as price is below that
18:57
above the uh 60k level the 61k level then I'm looking for a continuation
19:09
higher right let's move on to Total
19:15
two what's interesting here is did anybody see my tweet from this
19:21
morning the reference that I made between total
19:26
2 total 3 and the SPX
19:43
so what's what's fascinating again is let's just start from the high time frame context for the bands okay again
19:50
the the key point of today's stream is just more context and why I'm looking to take risk
19:57
on looking at the weekly time frame
20:05
here the 12 and the 25s are are price is very close to the
20:11
12 and 25s okay any pushes up now later this week and we get
20:20
acceptance Above This level into the weekly close there's a high possibility that we
20:25
can see this flip back in into a bullish signal using the 12 25s
20:32
okay we in terms of the Bands again the key thing to notice here is look at the
20:38
trajectory when you are in a bare Market the velocity of trajectories to the
20:44
downside is fairly aggressive when you are in a consolidation or consolidation
20:51
phase of consolidation okay you will see the bands pretty much dissipate to the side
20:57
okay trend in sideways as price is going through that corrective phase so any flips Above This
21:05
level and holds that's a reason for me to be further more aggressive into the coming
21:11
weeks heading into November and December
21:21
okay so again I really do like how the market is setting up across the board
21:29
let's look at total three same again I do believe this is signal ball okay it's
21:34
holding above that level the bands are starting to cross up so very very encouraging to see in the market we've
21:41
had six months of
21:54
consolidation so I'm looking for that continuation higher ideally I want to see the bands hold the
22:00
12 and the 25 don't mind any weeks below I think that presents buying opportunities but
22:07
expectation is for this to trade higher now when you look at the RSI as
22:15
well above the 50 level okay very encouraging to see it's the same I
22:21
believe on total 2 it's just hovering give or take at
22:27
that 50 level and again when you look at Bitcoin as well above that 50 level so that's also
22:34
very very encouraging for me the fact that we're above the bands price is starting to
22:39
make higher highs and higher lows within this Range band environment and the RSI
22:45
is above 50 some more reasons again in terms of context why I'm looking to be
22:52
aggressive in Q4 until conditions tell me otherwise
23:05
now I'm going to go back to Total two again like I said in today's stream we just want to focus on
23:14
context when you look [Music]
23:19
at the charts okay and I'm going very very slow this stream when you look at the charts here
23:27
we've had six months of markets trending lower or rotationally going lower in
23:32
terms of lower lows and lower uh
23:40
highs you've got our lows here we've got a high okay this is a higher low another
23:47
higher high into a higher low we're now starting to see that shifting context
23:53
before we're likely to see acceleration if this is a bullish market so that's one aspect that I want you to pay
23:59
attention to and such that my invalidation now is this consolidation region here I really want to see this
24:07
structure hold if there is a pullback when or if there is a pullback on total to we'll probably
24:13
see corresponding pullbacks across many altcoins I think that again is an opportunity to position in for buying
24:21
the dip okay I'm not necessarily advocating for the fact that I think it's a time to short I think the
24:28
ible play here is to be patient if there is a pullback to look for those pullbacks or start scaling into
24:34
positions leaving plenty of ammo dry if there is a pullback you can add to your positions as well okay for those of you
24:40
who might be underexposed and you're looking for some good setups and there's some fantastic setups that still exist
24:46
across the board I I can appreciate that Meme coins have ran right but there are still ample opportunities in the AI
24:51
sector into some fairly decent projects out there that have good solid underlying fundamentals which will mat
24:57
in a b Market let's look at total three again it's the same kind of
25:03
structure that I'm looking at you see this rounding of a bottom we've had uh
25:10
lower highs lower lows another uh lower low lower high into another low into a
25:15
lower high higher low higher high higher low okay that shift in structure now
25:22
when you look at the SPX and if if we go to the two-day or
25:30
the 3-day chart whichever one you want entirely up to you very similar in that
25:35
sell off we had this Zone here as a consolidation
25:41
right price trending up break of Market structure lower high okay we broke this
25:48
lower low lower high Trend down there's our lows lower high lower
25:56
low you're looking for that shift in structure on
26:03
price and what we then saw on ES and it's not so much that I'm
26:09
comparing total 2 and total 3 to the SPX it's more about the actual structure and
26:16
what you want to observe in terms of continuation going higher so we can we can see that
26:23
eventually we had our significant lows at this level
26:30
here the first significant higher low into a higher high into a higher low
26:37
consolidation compression into resistance expansion to the upside that's kind of what my expectation is or
26:44
what I would be looking for over the coming weeks and months on total two and total
26:52
three so I do so for the time being there are some alt coins that will rally
26:58
significantly other altcoins will be still fairly somewhat rotational price will trade higher pull back fairly steep
27:05
20 30 40% Corrections relative to where price is trade again higher into a
27:10
higher high back again into a higher low until you see acceleration into a significant Trend going high that's kind
27:17
of what I'm looking for now in terms of uh the charts on total two and total
27:25
three so you can see that the context what I'm looking for so again in terms
27:31
of expectations right if we are in a truly bullish environment then I'm
27:37
looking for that shift
27:49
higher and potentially at some point the question is will we get a pull back into
27:54
this level there's a new high into another high low into some form of compression then
28:00
breakout at some point in Q4 that's what I'm looking
28:07
for where am I wrong on this idea I've already stated that clear that should
28:13
price still just be contained within a range then we just have to
28:20
accept accept the market for what it's worth okay but equally again I'm not looking at this market and thinking to
28:26
right if we reject here I'm going to short this all the way back down I think the sensible play considering the fact that alts have retraced 70 80 90% over
28:34
the last 6 months the more sensible approach for me is being patient that should structures break down then
28:42
reposition again in November in December but for now I'm leaning towards price
28:47
printing a higher high that's what I'd like to see the question is whether we get that I'm hopeful we will into a
28:54
higher low and then continuation into a trending market across AC cross alt coins
29:05
okay I just want to have a quick peek of the SPX with the
29:14
um Trend scanner during that period
29:20
of correction that we had
29:37
all right so you can see again just just a basic set of moving averages the
29:42
period of red this is a market that you don't want to be trading or pissing in pissing
29:48
Against the Wind you don't want to be trying to long this on the way down equally you don't want to be shorting
29:57
when you see p per of large green okay positive bullish signals the trend is to
30:02
the upside any reversions under the bands is shortlived reclaims back above
30:07
that's continuation higher shortlived reclaim back above continuation higher that's kind of what I'm looking for over
30:14
the coming weeks and months on total 2 and total three to give me that contextual bias that you know it's it's
30:20
encouraging to remain bullish or looking for long opportunities on altcoin so again looking at total two here on ter
30:27
in terms of the uh the two-day and the daily you can see we've had a period of
30:34
significant red we now have flipped green a very short period of red before
30:40
flipping bullish again now if you remember what I covered
30:45
um on the previous stream do you remember the three signals that I I talked about when you get a bully signal
30:52
into a bearish signal back into a bullish very very quickly that's often a sign of strength
30:58
anybody recall that and you will see those examples on several alt
31:04
coins uh across the market I believe tier is one of
31:12
them where you have okay let me just get rid of the lines bull into a bear back into a bull
31:21
long okay that's pretty much why I along to you yesterday I've observed this to
31:26
be and you can back test this this right in when you're looking for Trend reversals using the daily time frame
31:32
using the 1225 or whichever EMA strategy you wish to use this is a fairly decent
31:41
signal okay and it is just a signal in Confluence with all your the technical
31:47
levels but again something that I look for to give me the trigger of the signal
31:52
to start get getting back into long mode looking for that shiting context okay we've had months and months of
31:59
downtrends okay into a range and I've always talked about the fact that when
32:04
price is in a Range by environment you want to see the bands compress from uh going into a very shortlived bull back
32:11
into a bear bull for several days back into the bear and quickly back into the
32:16
bull mode again again okay then you're looking for that continuation higher so again just something to bear in mind
32:30
and again if you remember why did I long say off the lows we saw that same
32:35
pattern repeat again this is on the daily Ball Bear back into a ball very very quickly look at the compression of
32:40
the Bands when you see this quick toggle from B back into a bear back into Bol and the bear is very
32:46
very shortlived it's offering a good good good show of strength in the market so again very very simple strategy that
32:53
you can observe and look for strength or shifts in a possible shift in context
32:58
the fact that price is at the lows it's not just the fact that this is going to happen anywhere in the middle of the chart it's relevant to where you wish to
33:07
see a good buying opportunity this was clearly into a demand Zone after months of selling price finds a range of an
33:14
accumulation we get the trigger this is what I talk about in terms of Tails side longing the Tails side of accumulation
33:21
this is one of those triggers that gives me the strategy to start stepping into the trade all right so again it's quite
33:26
effective something that I've used over the years and something that I still continue to use to give me a trigger to
33:32
go
33:39
along the the trigger on tier was the uh again when you look at TI it was the the
33:45
the 12 and the 25s on the 12h hour okay so generally
33:50
you know I've talked about the daily but you can potentially front run the signal is when you drop down to a lower time
33:56
frame like the 12 and that that's what the that's that
34:02
was the key for me essentially the the 12-hour uh back into the bull confirmed on The Daily later that day okay upon
34:10
the close of that day we got the
34:16
confirmation so again I think when I look at this across the board there are some fantastic opportunities and I am
34:23
positioned long on tier I think there's every possibility for as long as this
34:28
again remains respecting price at this key
34:33
level of around about 450s I think there's every possibility that we do or
34:38
or I certainly will be looking to trade us back into the 12 at least back into the tws any pullbacks over the coming
34:44
weeks again for me it's just a position a an opportunity to add to some spot
34:49
position I've left plenty of um ammunition to add to any pullbacks
34:57
and eventually when the per play sets up which is a break Above This current range okay in terms of the local range
35:05
potentially a mid-range between this high and this low that's when I'll start flooring it on Futures as well
35:11
okay so I've always talked about accumulating my spot positions in this base like consolidation call it whatever
35:18
you want whether it's a range whether this is a shoulder a head an inverse Head and Shoulders whatever you want to
35:25
call it look for continuation higher into to the range highs and once we find acceptance back above that's the trend
35:31
continuation into 12 which is where I'm looking to trade on
35:40
purose how to get the trend scanner you just go to indicators and type in um just type in EXO you'll see Trader EXO
35:47
macro Tren scanner coded by BTC Charlie
35:59
Ena let's look at Ena because that was one that I um talked about on previous
36:04
streams I currently have taken profit on my um Futures position I was long from
36:11
29s I shared the setup on the timeline I I gave kind of not a live commentary but
36:16
I talked about where I'm looking to buy and where I'm looking to position on Ena and it's moved nicely to the to the
36:24
highs but for now look we are into a level of resistance as is Bitcoin at 66k
36:29
I think if there are any pullbacks then for me the level would have to be again
36:35
just using a very very simple strategy is using the bands look at the
36:45
weekly we can't gain too much from there okay so we'll go down to the 3-day where there's more
36:51
data there's a very high probability that for as long as price respects that
36:58
33 34 cents level back into the bands and this gives you a bullish signal I'm
37:04
looking for that continuation higher into $1 I do think we could could could very well potentially get $1 in terms of
37:10
a higher time frame Target but immediate targets would be 50 60 and so forth but that's the big rounded bottom structure
37:18
context that I'm looking for the only issue that I have okay in terms of look I don't know what's going to happen
37:24
heading into the elections are we going to see a period of risk off into the elections and even if we do so what you
37:30
know it's just another opportunity as far as I'm concerned that we've had several months of a downtrending
37:40
market and if there is another pullback that's going to be again for anybody who
37:46
isn't positioned and I'm not just talking about Ena but structurally on alt coins across the board I think
37:51
that's going to present you a very good buying opportunity give you an even bigger base to Rally off looking for at least $1
37:59
okay that's kind of what I'm thinking about in terms of the high time frame context but having said that when you
38:04
look at the 3day this really does look Prime to cross uh or at least give a ball signal when you look at the two-day
38:10
I would probably guess that it already has signal that which there we are okay we've got the signal there on the
38:16
two-day and we already know what's happening on the daily for the first time in quite some time
38:21
Ona we had a very short period of green but the minute we got back under that level with the ball with the bare signal
38:29
sell off okay that's the trend look at the trajectory of the moving averages you don't want to be again counter Trend
38:37
trading this you want to flow in the direction of price until you get a slow down of momentum when you get a Slowdown
38:44
of momentum it's often a rangeb environment you can play the rotational aspects of the range now I'm looking for
38:51
the trend breakout over the coming weeks and months back back up to at least 50 cents
39:00
$1 okay that's what I'd be looking for so again using a very simple
39:05
reversion strategy looking for a pull back into the bands even if we rally higher and we get that uh fairly steep
39:11
pullback back into 40 cents and the bands are line that's kind of the strategy that I'm going to be looking
39:16
for in terms of Sr levels with the bands very simple strategy works very well for me if we get fine acceptance back inside
39:23
the range then you just have to accept it take what the mark it gives you and
39:28
and cut your losses there
39:40
okay now recall what I also said about the monthly open strategy so not only can you use the bands you can also use
39:47
the uh monthly open strategy again it was
39:52
another reason why I took the long on uh celesia why I'm positioned long and I'm looking for p pull backs if there is a
39:58
pullback into 550 which is the monthly open I'm just going to have to my spot position I just think when you zoom out
40:04
look at the chart you've got to look at the structures You' got to think to yourself well there's a very good chance
40:11
that prices are likely Ur certainly continue higher over the coming weeks and months okay and that's what I want
40:17
to position for the the trades on perose like I said is once I see the shift in
40:23
context with higher highs and higher lows and the uh the moving averages showing me that the the shift in
40:29
momentum that's when I start flooring it on perss okay but again in these environments it's it's essentially what
40:36
I'm looking for in terms of building positions for uh those significant moves
40:43
higher without really being exposed to Too Much leverage and it's again when you think of the
40:48
mindset give the trade a chance to breathe it's not going to take off overnight and when you're chasing price
40:54
you're often going to find that you're buying the highs and price Braes and you cut it it jumps back up higher you chase
41:00
it again just give price a chance to develop give yourself some mental
41:05
capacity to build a position okay it's still very early it's still within a range okay uh especially something likea
41:14
when you look at this September monthly open October monthly open so any pullbacks into this
41:20
or below right even if we trade below the the September monthly uh October
41:26
monthly open and it flips back above that is your shiting structure that's your higher low that's
41:33
your higher high that's your higher low back above the uh monthly open step back into trade looking for a higher
41:39
high okay and you can keep building to the position once you break out of this range looking for price to uh continue
41:47
high in terms of a trending market so just keeping a very simple
41:54
simple simple approach for the for those of you who are finding it difficult to hold your
42:03
positions or even looking at the market not knowing where to position or how to
42:09
position you probably see mean coins run fairly aggressive I just think that if mean coins are already up 3 four five
42:15
Sixx off the lows yes they could go significantly higher but I also think there's going to be an opportunity in
42:22
some of the utility coins and the some of the higher caps midc caps which will present some very good trading
42:27
opportunities as
42:40
well all right there's a lot of chart requests Zig okay we'll have a look at Zig uh because I bought into this
42:47
today again I think I really like these types of
42:53
structures um I'll give an example so SZ
42:59
was trading something called fog which has done very very well again
43:05
various just ignore the time series aspect of the chart look at the structural aspect of
43:12
the chart this was range Bound for the best
43:18
part of August September mid October okay when you look at this you
43:25
think right this is going to roll over but what what often happens is price runs a
43:30
significant set of lows and they just rips higher I'll show you another example
43:37
where this
43:52
happen and the reason I can pin these out Point these out is because I was there observing price watching price
43:59
trade these types of structures they give you very aggressive moves I do believe it's a phase of
44:05
reaccumulation but you get price where it's just grinding grinding grinding lower and you think that there's no
44:11
buyer stepping into the market the volume is very very low if you look at the actual volume
44:18
indicator very subdued okay and when when you run It
44:24
Forward price just takes off on thin boook thin Supply price will move fairly quick okay that's the kind of setup or
44:33
trade that I'm looking for on Zig over the coming weeks I don't know when it's going to play out I couldn't tell you
44:39
but again just understanding how I'm thinking of structures I'm not really
44:44
into the classic meme structures which is like as sending triangles or Head and Shoulders pattern or uh C and handles
44:51
not into that for me it's more about these type of structures that I pay attention to and I've just given you two
44:57
examples there one was on fog the other one was pal so again just something similar that I'm looking for over the coming weeks like should there be
45:03
another push down into the 8 cents I've already positioned from 10 cents or just under 10 if I get 8 cents that will give
45:09
me a a basis of round about 9 cents looking for price to go back up into 20s
45:14
okay so just again I'm not specifically talking just about Zig but I'm trying to
45:21
give you some contextual understanding of structures to look for
45:35
is that clear one for the
45:40
Scrapbook six months of six months of price trading sideways one of the strongest coins when many of the coins
45:46
were falling off a cliff
46:02
just give me a second
46:46
that's what I'd be thinking of okay where you've got consolidation slow drift down and eventually price just
46:53
rips up out of nowhere all right there you go takech example of what that looks like in terms
47:01
of those of you are into wickoff
47:09
structures right let's have a look at some alt coins just very briefly I did say I was going to cover ethereum but
47:15
we'll cover ethereum on the stream but looking at this already positioned uh
47:20
tweeted it live talked about it in the previous streams I'm not going to repeat myself but if you want to figure out what my thought process is for for those
47:27
of you who watch the previous streams you know exactly what I talked about uh when I believe price was over here I
47:32
said that there's every possibility that we're going to see one more correction structure doesn't quite look ready to break out so again just talking about
47:38
structures talking about what you need to see happen on the chart and now we're getting that push
47:49
out and I'll give you another example of the uh the um
47:57
I think we're going to see it very very soon so again if you remember where I talked about where you in a Range B
48:04
environment after a selloff you get this bull signal followed by a bear I think there's every possibility this is going
48:10
to Signal bull tomorrow especially the way this is closing which is very very encouraging and I think very encouraging
48:17
for the broader Market that we we we could see continuation higher allbe baring some pullbacks but
48:23
again that's kind of the level that if there is a pullback into 20 5 or
48:28
24s I want to see this mid level hold and then continuation higher and I'm
48:34
guessing that on the 12h hour there's there's every possibility that this is now signal bullish maybe yesterday or
48:42
the day before well hey there there you go Okay so we've got it Cannon today so very
48:47
very encouraging to see again when you look at the uh the weekly on this it
48:54
still has some work to do on the weekly in terms of the band so I I don't suspect we're going to get that
49:00
aggressive breakout just yet on ethereum but uh it it's certainly looking encouraging let's look at the
49:07
3day yeah still needs a bit of work on the 3-day ideally I want to see price
49:14
trading above the bands and then we're going to see a form of compression on the 12 and the 25 so maybe essentially
49:22
what would that look like the 12 and the 25 compressing price pushes above pulls
49:27
back and then you're going to get that fast move into this previous Supply Zone here that's kind of what I'm looking for
49:33
or alternatively pull back into 24s continuation
49:47
higher let's look at Nero I I think this has got some legs on it
49:52
um it's already in the top 100 now SE nail from 1 to 2 million market cap to a
49:58
billion dollar market cap absolutely insane insane insane call really
50:05
is but again anybody who's trying to short this good luck he's just pissing
50:10
your money away if you're trying to short
50:16
this all right let's look at some charts pal I'll spend five minutes very
50:21
quickly looking at pal yep look I think a lot of these charts look very s very familiar of in terms of structure you
50:28
you just got a a beautiful set of lows here which has been June July August
50:34
September so in terms of basing structures this is what you want to see base structures being formed big rounded
50:41
bottoms You could argue that this is a shiting structure okay we've had a real
50:48
ShakeOut price print a a higher high relative to this swing Point into a
50:55
higher low I'd be looking now at some point in the coming weeks barring a pullback into another higher high higher
51:02
low into that type of structure there okay that's what I'd be looking for now if you look at Myro anybody take the
51:10
Myro setup that I shared on stream previously I think I covered it last
51:16
week
51:22
anybody there's too many questions in the chat for me to keep up
51:28
but there you go okay caps by the uh trend line I said
51:35
specifically on the stream that any pullbacks into the September monthly open even if it's just a deviation below
51:42
the September monthly open and it gets back above that is the opportunity to go long
51:49
okay I don't know how clearer I could have been in my
51:55
explanation but that was the trigger and I said specifically doesn't matter even if it comes deep into
52:00
here let it get acceptance back above that's your trigger to go along
52:05
okay and you've just got to be patient with these types of plays when the
52:10
broader Market is telling you that alts are rallying alts are starting to Trend higher alts are starting to reclaim back
52:17
of back above their monthly open if you look at this from a range
52:22
perspective August September into October and you're trying to fade the first
52:28
significant breakout of a range then you're trading this the wrong way okay and you and equally for those
52:35
of you who have managed to position but you're just giving giving back or you're
52:40
just taking profit very very prematurely and fully closing out your position not not appre appreciating that look at the
52:48
structure pric is making here we've had a significant retracement of price over
52:54
6 months if eventually there's going to be a reversion back up at least into 16 17
53:01
cents I'm personally targeting These Eyes here for give or take an 8 n 10 R
53:06
trade okay I'm still in this trade
53:11
setup now I'll give you another setup that looks really good is I think it's
53:16
Jupiter again when you look at this April May June July what is this
53:24
here the high into significant low lower high equal lows lower high equal lows
53:31
lower high equal lows equal highs okay this is that rounded bottom
53:38
very similar to what I shared on whiff okay remember when I talked about the laws on whiff on the timeline it was
53:45
around here this area here the target we've hit the trade is
53:54
done for me okay I'm waiting now for another setup on Whi I'm not looking to long into resistance but in terms of a
54:01
range on
54:07
whiff there we go okay there's a chart I had from uh the previous stream or the
54:13
timeline it above the September monthly open that was that would have been my invalidation if we got back below it I
54:19
would have stepped aside continuation higher into that area well I circled it
54:25
here but we've kind of P that level now in terms of with what am I looking for again like I said if there is a
54:31
correction if there is a corrective move two ways I can look to do this okay so
54:36
in terms of trade setups what you're going to find and I want you to pay very very close
54:42
attention to this okay what you're going to find is is a
54:47
certain um chartist are going to tell you that
54:54
whiff has taken the highs I'm going to short this Market I'm going to take a short on here and I'm going to Target all the way back down because this is a
54:59
deviation okay I think what you really have to
55:04
think about is a broader context of the market look at what Bitcoin is doing look at what ethereum is doing look at what total 2 and total 3 are doing look
55:11
at the structures that I've given you yes it is a swing fill of these
55:17
Highs but understand the context that you're in
55:27
and the key point that I want to make is that all right let's just assume shorts are building up into this they might get
55:33
some success at least down into this level here into this demand Zone but the minute price goes back up and takes out
55:41
their stops okay or they get stopped out look at the inefficiency on the left hand side there's absolutely nothing
55:48
here until $350 so when this [ __ ] moves and it gives a a shallow pullback where shorts
55:55
think they're in control all and then price just rips one candle up pushing
56:00
back into resistance and then [ __ ] them over it's not going to [ __ ] about if it gets if you see this shallow pullback
56:08
and price push us back up into resistance I'd say the probability is that we're going to fill in this thin
56:14
inefficiency at least trade back into 350s if we get that pullback that's what I'll be looking for so I am looking to
56:19
get back into with from a long perspective I'm just not sure where yet let price develop let's see where
56:25
Bitcoin let's see what Bitcoin is going to do it is at resistance if Bitcoin does pull into that 63k level then
56:32
looking at the chart here um working this in just ranges this is our
56:38
ksr round about here round about this level here okay into that daily demand
56:44
Zone and what's going to be key for me is Market structure high high higher low another
56:51
high another higher low high I want to see price come down into this level respect the wick okay respect this
56:58
candle here I don't want to see acceptance below it as close as possible start pushing away stop below this level
57:06
here I'll start scaling in looking for price to to go back up into that 290 level and potentially higher into that
57:14
uh 353 370 390 level does that make
57:20
sense in context with what Bitcoin could potentially do now if Bitcoin breaks up
57:25
higher into 6 68 69 70k what do you think these what do you think ALS are going to do in that
57:32
sense so again looking at structure right big rounded bottom over
57:39
many months let's go back to what I said on
57:45
Jupiter again looking for a very similar play
57:51
here looking for that move back up into 120s any pullbacks I'm going to start scaling
57:57
in because I think this is a good enough of a
58:06
base clear the chart that's the base uh level that I'm
58:12
looking for you can use the monthly opens all right so we've got September monthly
58:18
open here okay and I talked about the fact on
58:24
the previous stream look for those p P backs into the September monthly open that's the area where you want to do
58:30
your business if it gets below let it get acceptance back above you're going to get the trigger to go long inv
58:37
validation out the lows your first objective is a mid then this and then you got the highs okay that's how I
58:44
would be looking to trade this so for me my objective on this now is going to be that 130 level and I'm not even in this
58:51
trade yet so I'm looking to um
58:59
looking to get into this um trade
59:15
here another example is GTO same setup same type of structure
59:21
range lows these are the type of setups that I I I really look forward
59:34
to okay so again any pullbacks if there are
59:40
any I think it's it's a position where I'd be comfortable buying into spot for
59:46
as long as we find that price of respecting the 170 level I think even from a risk reward perspective just even
59:53
if you do get a shallow pullback
59:59
stop is below 175s first objective is 335 then you got to go for the highs
1:00:06
okay it's kind of what I'd be looking
1:00:12
for what about say you say I'm already in say I've covered it several times
1:00:18
again look looking at where the bands are we're in a Range band environment
1:00:23
any pull back into these uh this consolidation
1:00:28
here okay that same structure compression then you're going to get the
1:00:34
breakout or at least what I'd be hoping for invalidation for me is uh should
1:00:39
price break below um 38 then I'd have to take profit on my spot that I bought
1:00:45
here and here so I took a second spot position of 39 if we start trading below
1:00:51
there then I'll have to cut that spot position and if we start trading below here I'll to take profit on this one
1:00:56
here over over
1:01:05
there but again look at the bands don't fade the bands okay very simple
1:01:11
strategy and when you look at sui as an
1:01:20
example why in your right mind would you want to short this is is this a distribution
1:01:28
top look at what the bands are telling you this is a distribution top okay look
1:01:35
at the trajectory of the bands and then we get a Range band environment into a
1:01:40
possible distributive environment and then we get the breakdown okay it's
1:01:45
still too early to even be contemplating shorts on this if you're looking for shorts it's
1:01:53
not here you might yeah you might you might ping a short off this and get get get a trade into 190s but
1:02:01
contextually this is not the zone for
1:02:12
me and the other point I want to make here is um when you look at suie
1:02:35
right you'd you'd look at this here and this is what many altcoins are doing right
1:02:40
now you'd look at this and you think the stock RSI is at the highs
1:02:46
here it's looking fairly
1:02:52
oversold but what you have to remember in a trending Market oscillators can
1:02:57
remain oversold and overbought to the upside and oversold to the downside in a
1:03:02
trending market and if you look at what happens over the coming weeks we all kind of know what SE has
1:03:10
done it's still remaining overbought over one to 3 weeks in already and then
1:03:18
you're going to get people trying to short this when I've told you clearly that you've only got to look at the bands why are you trying to short the
1:03:24
momentum to the upside even the daily here is
1:03:29
overb for at least several days at least but again when you look at the
1:03:42
weekly price is still pushing higher let's look at the daily it's already
1:03:48
oscillated to the lows as price is compressing
1:03:54
consolidating and trending higher and it's retesting the bands on on the 1221
1:04:00
then you get that compression continuation higher and the bands are re uh the stockers reset at the lows
1:04:07
looking for an oscillation to the highs that's going to give you that momentum to the upside
1:04:13
okay that's how I want you to think about markets and using oscillators
1:04:18
don't get um call offside just because this is oversold so again using this
1:04:26
example when you look at something like say you'd look at this and you think
1:04:32
yeah you know what the um the weekly is fairly
1:04:38
um fairly overbought but again look at the bands any pullbacks if there is
1:04:46
one into that 41 42 cents level look at how price has reacted from it previously
1:04:52
on the previous two weekly candles it's reacted from that level pushing higher
1:04:59
again when you look at the daily the daily bands are intact oscillating to the highs yeah so any pullbacks into
1:05:05
that 35 34 33 cents level is is probably where I'm going to look to take another Futures
1:05:13
trade yeah Wormhole looks very good I traded Wormhole really well I think when
1:05:18
you look at the daily it's looking really good when you look at the weekly it's literally starting to flip the
1:05:25
bands here although we are limited on data uh therefore I have to go for the 3-day bands but again we've shifted
1:05:32
above the 3day for the first time and uh it's it's tested that band perfectly
1:05:39
about 32 so I think this will evidently if the Market's bullish
1:05:46
looking for continuation higher you've got a shoulder you've got a head another
1:05:52
shoulder look for that continuation and there you go there's the inverse okay and then then you got thin in efficiency
1:05:57
at least up into 50 cents and potentially 70 cents that's kind of the structure that I'd be looking
1:06:05
for fet we'll have a look at fet very similar shoulder head shoulder
1:06:13
inverse Head and Shoulders it's turned bullish on the 3-day weekly it looks like it's going to
1:06:19
flip bullish at some point next week or potentially this week daily looks good
1:06:25
good looks very good for as long as we respect Market
1:06:31
structure okay for as long as we respect this uh 130s
1:06:38
level that's the sport that I want to see hold and then you're looking for continuation Above This above these
1:06:44
highs and I think that opens the floodgates back to um 240 to 260 or at
1:06:50
least that's what I'd be looking to trade towards
1:06:57
all right guys I think that's going to be it um I'm obviously very very tired I keep stut stuttering over my words and
1:07:03
stumbling over my words lack of sleep sleep deprivation and uh I think I need to
1:07:09
reset I've been uh trading Saturday Sunday and today for the best part I'm due for a long session of sleep being
1:07:16
managed some fairly sizable perps position double my perss account so far this month so I think I'm just going to
1:07:22
reset I've taken profit on a lot of my per setups and I'm looking to um looking
1:07:28
for some clear setups later this
1:07:36
week does that make sense but again I've just tried to keep things very simple you know forget all this [ __ ] about open
1:07:42
interest and funding rates and this and that the just just focus on the basics of price okay and I always try to keep
1:07:49
these videos very price focused understand structure understand
1:07:56
context understand what you're looking for what you need to see where you're likely to be wrong in an idea and as
1:08:03
soon as you're wrong you know as Traders we're going to get many things wrong okay but it's just understanding when
1:08:08
you need to get out the trade and preserve your cash to live for another day all
1:08:17
right apart from that have a great week ahead and uh I'll catch you on the other
1:08:22
side of the stream later this week God bless take care and peace out
