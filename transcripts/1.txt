all right we should be live good evening everybody it's TR X
0:08
here once again with another midweek live stream the first one back after
0:14
quite some time it's Thursday the 19th of September 2024 the time is 1 p.m. BSC or 9 just
0:23
after 9:00 p.m. UTC if you could all give me a quick audio check in the chat and like you can
0:30
see my screen and we shall uh kick off the
0:54
stream all good yeah all right just a slight delay I was waiting for the responses but great
1:00
I hope you're all well as always good to see the regular faces in the chat hello
1:06
to you all and hope you're having a fabulous September no doubt the the the suspense
1:11
of the rate Cuts has passed us by and we can get back to business as normal so a
1:18
special thank you to Prime xbt for once again partnering with me and they've
1:24
been long-term partners and sponsors of my streams over the years which allows me to um share my thoughts some views
1:30
with you guys obviously so as always anything said in today's video is not
1:35
Financial advice as always it's just my view of the markets and how I'm primarily looking to trade the markets
1:43
before I proceed I just want to make sure I've I've slightly configured my microphone that you can all hear me okay
1:48
is it definitely loud and clear and there's no um audio
1:55
issues I will'll kick off
2:11
all right so first things first um do let me know if my if my voice does
2:16
distort because I'm kind of positioned in a weird way with the various screens
2:21
that I've got up with this new setup but we're going to start from the monthly chart so the first thing that stands out
2:27
the first question I have for you guys are we
2:33
above the quarter level on this High time frame range yes or no okay and one
2:40
thing I've advocated for is if you watched the previous stream that for as
2:45
long as price remains above the yearly mid level I don't really have any
2:52
concerns that I'm looking for long opportunities in the
2:58
market sentiment was was fairly bearish when I was last on stream I emphasize on
3:03
the fact that whenever price is at the the top end of the range we see the
3:09
majority consensus on the timeline calling for 70 80 90 100K and then when
3:15
it's trading at the opposite side all of a sudden we're in a distribution range and everybody's calling for 30k and
3:22
lower down okay and I touched upon the fact that there's so much price action left before we can even consider one
3:29
extreme of you let's just be objective let's just take price for what it is and what it tells us and look for good
3:36
trading opportunities now from a spot perspective I've
3:42
just slightly uh increased my exposure to to bitcoin once we reclaimed back
3:49
above 54k so I do hold just some spot exposure but primarily I think over the
3:55
coming weeks I'm looking to trade Bitcoin that's just my personal objective I'm sure there's many of you
4:00
who are probably holding spot want to continue to hold spot that's absolutely fine my personal preference is I rather
4:07
trade Bitcoin over the coming weeks potentially over the coming months okay and I'll explain why that is that's just
4:12
my objective and how I like to trade Bitcoin as long as long as I'm out outperforming Bitcoin from a trading
4:19
perspective then I'll continue doing that until if I stop outperforming
4:25
Bitcoin as a benchmark as a Trader with my Bitcoin trades then it probably makes more sense to me to stay exposed to spot
4:32
and manage my downside risks ultimately looking at the chart okay the key thing for me is like
4:39
I said we're above the mid uh the the mid of this range from 44k to the the
4:46
70k level let's go into the weekly same
4:52
again okay we talked about the yearly low and we also mapped
4:59
out yearly High we'll do that in
5:05
blue I'm just going to go very slow on this stream today we'll probably spend 20 minutes half an hour max okay very
5:11
simple objective charts there's our yearly low 22nd of January there's the yearly High round about the 11th of
5:19
March we marked out the mid which essentially mapped out the the year Li
5:24
mid level and I specifically stated that for as long as price remains above the
5:31
yearly mid level I don't have any real concerns as to you know thinking
5:36
about bearing in mind I said thinking about looking to short this level we've coming to a level of support the only
5:44
time that I'm going to think about buying lower down is if we find acceptance below 52k or 50k and we start
5:52
trading below this demand Zone into what appears to be the next Lal logical level
5:57
of support which is round about that 38 to 40K level I also talked about about
6:03
the fact that the 200 weekly moving average is hovering somewhere around here but that was an adverse scenario I
6:10
said if price breaks down then logically that's probably going to be one of the areas that I certainly will be looking
6:16
to buy should it break down okay so quite clearly Bitcoin has respected the
6:22
the the demand Zone that we we highlighted and for me the point is look
6:29
there was a lot of discussion about um comparisons being made if you
6:36
recall back in July or August that Bitcoin is is is to some extent looking
6:43
like it's about to make a move similar to what we saw in May
6:49
2021 my question for you is very very simple it's such
6:54
that does this okay the fact that we are making or that we have
7:02
printed a lower high a lower low lower high lower low lower high fine that's
7:09
okay but when you truly look at this structure over the last 6 months is this more akin to a rotational
7:17
range bar environment or is this akin to a trend
7:23
down now clearly you can see where is the trend there there really isn't no evident Trend to the downside which can
7:29
consists of momentum aggressive selling which causes price to Rally low down
7:34
without any real significant pullback okay until it f finds the next level of
7:40
support we don't seem to be um witnessing that in terms of Bitcoin
7:47
what we have seen right is the fact that price has come in so this is our yearly
7:52
uh mid-level I'm just going to mark this as in in in uh red sorry so just to highlight this key demand Zone that
8:00
I've put a lot of emphasis on and the key thing to note here is that we've had
8:05
one attempt two attempts three attempts into into are very close into
8:13
this demand Zone okay yet price every time has traded for a brief period of
8:20
time below this yearly mid level and closed back above and pushed up high and
8:25
again and again so when you see that on the charts the next question you want to be asking
8:32
yourself is what is price telling you what is the actual Logic for being short biased knowing that price has just
8:38
traded below the yearly level it's tagged a very key pivotal demand Zone
8:44
and it's found acceptance back up a 44 uh 54k level why in that instance are
8:50
you looking for looking for shorts so it's clearly evident that three failed
8:55
attempts to find acceptance below the early midlevel can't even trade into the demand Zone in terms of
9:02
candle closes just Wicks that should tell you that buyers are stepping into to the market at this level okay this is
9:09
a Zone where you want to be or should have been looking to buy now for those of you who followed my streams or follow
9:15
the timelines I've been very vocal about buying these lows below the yearly mid level looking for those reclaims it's
9:21
worked every time we've had a good reaction we've traded up into the 63k level Okay so
9:29
from a high time frame perspective as long as we are above 55 56k level I don't have any concerns
9:35
about the downside I'm continuing to seek long opportunities in the market for what has predominantly been a
9:44
rotational range B environment where there's a market to be traded for both Longs and shorts at the
9:52
edges of the range okay where I don't particularly want to do my business is
9:57
is like I said is pretty much in the middle of nor man's land unless there's a significant pullback and contextually
10:04
it makes sense for me to continue looking for Longs in this instance when you think about the context here three
10:11
attempts to break below the early open we can't so therefore again any moves
10:16
lower down I think if you haven't already positioned or you're looking for long opportunities you're essentially looking for a move lower down we'll talk
10:22
about trade setups slightly ahead in the streams but I'm just trying to give you the contextual overview of price okay
10:30
now if you want to take it another step simpler when you look at areas of value
10:35
Bitcoin has predominantly been trading at that 59k level if you look at
10:41
the the majority of the price action it has been contained between the
10:46
69 sorry the uh 59 and 70k level okay every time price has broken below
10:54
this key swing low here at coming out all right call 56 give or take we've managed to find acceptance back inside
11:00
okay now how many more times is it going to take for Bitcoin to eventually gravitate to the
11:08
upside which is the scenario that I'm leaning towards okay so from a contextual perspective
11:15
I'm not aggressively looking for shorts I'm continuing to remain contextually
11:22
looking for Longs is that
11:27
clear yes we are ranging yes we are descending but the degree of
11:33
descent isn't all that aggressive if you really think about it and if you think of continuation
11:41
patterns here's an example for you to contemplate okay when you see something like this
11:49
okay price trends down and what does it do it goes into a corrective pattern now for those of you who
11:55
remember this I I fully remember trading this because many people assumed that
12:00
this was the range bound environment okay and the setup that I had it's actually on the
12:06
timeline Bitcoin was trading around about here and I clearly said that look my expectations are for Bitcoin to trade
12:12
up take out these highs the majority will probably get bullish because this is a breaking Market structure and
12:19
therefore their expect expectation is higher my expectation was the minute
12:24
this gets back inside it's going to sell off and that's essentially what happened we traded back to the lows so
12:30
you would think that the this is a series of higher highs higher lows higher highs therefore you'd think this
12:36
is bullish and therefore you'd think yeah we're going to go back to you know pretty much closer or push up to towards
12:42
alltime highs it clearly wasn't the case so contextually this was a corrective pattern from January February March
12:49
April May right before it broke down a good four or five months there equally when you think of this
12:57
structure here I don't see how this is is any different to what we've had in
13:02
this respect okay so again looking for that corrective consolidation that isn't
13:08
turning out to break into a distribution range which suggests that we're going to get marked down because clearly there's
13:14
no momentum to the downside so I I don't know where or why the cost of
13:20
distribution were were were being flagged up on the timeline but again
13:25
it's not unexpected when you when you see price Trading one side of the extreme and then
13:30
eventually you'd expect it to go to the other side of the extreme where you'll find mass Euphoria the whole point is
13:36
just to be objective and when you see these extreme sell-offs matched by
13:43
liquidations shorts piling in the Delta showing you the data quite often it
13:49
provides you with a very good long setup equally when you see aggressive Longs
13:54
opening at the highs being absorbed okay we'll and we'll touch upon Delta in a couple of weeks time I just want to give
13:59
you the contextual aspects of price when you see aggressive Longs piling in at this level open Interest really spiking
14:07
higher okay but price is unable to push above the range there's a good chance
14:12
that all these participants who trying to force or trade the breakout
14:18
anticipate the breakout will get trapped and the minute they get trapped they're going to close out their
14:24
positions once they're offside and price quickly reverts back to immune reversion
14:29
back to the mid-range or whatever okay that's just the nature of how markets work in a Range the chances of you
14:35
catching a breakout trade from a range are fairly low I don't know what the percentage
14:41
ratio is but quite often price trades above the range gets people trapped reverts back to the mid-range
14:49
okay we only have a clear definition once we find some level of acceptance
14:56
above the Range High and you see continuation or there's large enough volume you're going to see shorts get
15:02
absolutely annihilated in terms of liquidations Longs are piling in price will not [ __ ] about it will continue
15:07
pushing higher then you might get a shallow pull back before you see continuation higher after a good six
15:14
seven month period but we're we're still quite some time away from that so I'm just trying to give you the context in
15:19
thinking ahead of time and what generally happens at the range highs and the range lows and how the how the
15:25
sentiment shifts okay right let's take take you back now
15:31
um the other part that I want to focus on in in in this today's session
15:37
is let's look at the trend scanner which is a 1225 I've always been
15:43
calling it The 1221 incorrectly it's a 1225 when you look at this okay if my
15:50
concern here I did have some concern that if we take price back to where we
15:56
were the previous Sunday okay this is kind of where we
16:02
were at but under no circumstance or conditioned did I ever state that hey
16:08
I'm bearish I think it's time to get out the market my objectives was was very clear
16:13
as long as we respect this key demand zone right which you can clearly see
16:18
evident by this uh weekly time this was the consolidation which caused price to Rally higher price retest this level
16:25
comes back gives a rounded retest on The Daily okay there's your red retest that for me
16:31
was for buying okay the minute we found acceptance back above 54k that was the level to buy looking for price to push
16:38
back up to 61 62 into the bands that's where I've taken profit last week or earlier in the week I should say right
16:47
again where did this was the previous week on on the previous Sunday or whenever it was rolling It Forward I
16:53
started taking profit into 61k and I stayed flat until after f m c so now
17:00
what's interesting is as per the example that I gave is
17:05
that if this is bullish you want to see price find acceptance back above the bands you don't want to see the weekly
17:11
bands give a death cross this was another example very similarly that we
17:18
saw in October 2023 you can see the bands pinching literally about to death
17:23
cross but what does price do consolidates Under the bands and this is what's important is when you're using
17:29
moving averages pay very close attention to this one concept don't look at the bands from a single point of view and
17:36
think oh there's a chance of a death cross look at the context of price is price actually a fair distance away from
17:43
the bands or is price actually compressing and trading underneath the bands and like I said when price is
17:50
trading close to the bands despite the bands compressing there's always that possibility that it can pop to the
17:56
upside and when it does you don't want to be fading that momentum okay so just something to bear in mind
18:04
and and I gave an example of this on the timeline earlier in the week before this even happened is again when you look at
18:11
equities right es SPX we were so close so close to a death cross on the 1225
18:17
I've put 1221 here it should be the 1225 but price is very shortlived okay
18:25
and once it makes that impulse back above you really want be questioning whether you want to short the market or
18:31
is it perhaps easier to buy the pull back into the bands and just go with a momentum to the upside okay again this
18:38
is a corrective pattern very it could have been very easily assumed to be a a
18:43
bearish pattern because there's a breaking structure there's a lower high there's a lower low you'd think okay if
18:48
this is a lower high and rejects and the bands cross over then you've got more weight to start looking for shorts the
18:55
fact that this is now reclaimed above that 4350 level should really make you
19:00
realize the fact that hang on a minute price has just reclaimed a key level there's a real likelihood of trend
19:07
continuation here unless right unless you get something like this a deviation
19:13
or an over and under of over under of the bounds then you can say with conviction hang on a minute this isn't
19:20
great this is not what you expected you really wanted to see the level hold the minute it gets back under the bands
19:25
you've got your invalidation at highs now you can really start looking for the short with a certain greater degree of
19:32
confidence and conviction okay now when you go back to the Bitcoin chart again you've got to ask yourself
19:39
right okay yes price is coming into a level of resistance at 65k right there's
19:45
no denying that could this be the move which either we reject from this level
19:52
therefore it's a continuation of lower high lower high lower high another lower
19:57
high and another one but then what's key for me is are we likely to respect the
20:03
12 and the 25 moving average into what could potentially provide a very good
20:08
buying opportunity so the key level from a high time frame context is that 60k level and again when you draw the line
20:16
across the chart it's that key range level okay where majority of the price
20:22
action is traded with this being somewhat of a ShakeOut where I'm sure
20:29
many people have cut their positions or being led to shake out or this fear that we're going to go to 30k but what do we
20:35
see price doing find an acceptance back inside that key 60k level all right so
20:42
just something to think about that key 60k level that's where the 1225 bands are if we see a a corrective move down
20:49
from 65 back into that 61 60k level that's the level that you want to see
20:54
hold on for PR priv price to start pushing away from that level to really start entertaining Longs again should we
21:00
get the pull back okay is that
21:08
clear it's not a case of what's more accurate it's it doesn't matter if you use a 12 21 1225 you know the subtle
21:15
differences it's the context of price I'm not looking at the 1221 to give me a
21:20
perfect or the 1225 to give me a perfect inflection point it's a an inflection
21:27
point of ability it's a data point that I can take into
21:34
consideration such that I can then decide what's my next action what am I
21:39
likely to do next I'm being reactive to what price is telling me I'm not using
21:44
the moving averages like all right if it comes back into here I'm just going to buy but until it doesn't until it doesn't do that I'm just going to sit on
21:51
my hands no that's that's not the way to trade you just have to be prepared for that scenario if price comes into the
21:58
band ideally you want to see it hold it doesn't have to if it gets below the bands which is in this instance although
22:05
I've year marked 60k as that key level for me the clear inv validation is such
22:11
that all right look I've already given you two points of Confluence here this this this 59k
22:17
level 60k level you then have to ask yourself look with the bands pinching at
22:23
this level okay my expectancy here is for continuation higher but if this is a
22:29
rejection and then trades under here at that point I have to be open to the idea that well once again it it's quite
22:37
probable that we're going to trade back into the 54k level and based upon that
22:42
context I'll have to start thinking about trade setups on the lower time frame but the key is to get my context
22:47
right in the first instance very simple approach we're not
22:54
looking at open interest we're not looking at funding we're not looking at um all the other [ __ ] that gets Ted on
23:01
Twitter price action is King this is going to show you your structure this is going to help you make you understand
23:08
the levels where you wish to trade get this right get your principles right first then if you want to bring in all
23:13
the other points of data which adds Confluence go ahead and do so okay but most of my trading decisions
23:21
have been purely based upon price action understanding raw price action with volume to make a decision then
23:29
going on the lower time frames looking at liquidations looking at open interest and looking at the Delta to see where
23:36
participants are position are shorts getting aggressive into the lows are Longs getting aggressive into the highs
23:42
if they are I want to start taking profit or hedge with a short for any long exposure that I have and again if
23:48
you don't understand those points we will start touching upon them just for the first few videos I wanted to just
23:54
give a real primer on how I think about price action really slow down I'm looking for one or two trades a week Max
24:00
on bitcoin if I don't get one that's fine okay that's absolutely
24:05
fine but for now we are still within this rotational rangeb environment and
24:12
that's all there is to it
24:27
really hi how much of your decision so there's a question how much is how much of your decision making on the high time
24:34
frame is based on data versus discretion well it's all discretion the data is
24:39
basically okay there there's two ways to think about all right how I think about markets is understanding first of all
24:47
the levels I want to trade okay once I understand the levels that I wish to trade then I look for price and data
24:56
points on the lower time frame and that's where trade execution comes in
25:01
okay that's where I have a completely different set of rules that now that price is trading in this Zone how am I
25:07
looking to execute and that's where from the weekly I will drop to the 1 hour and have a look at what the 1 hour chart is
25:14
telling me looking for a potential uh trigger point in this
25:19
instance you know um I can't remember where it was it was this it this um Zone
25:24
here this was the 4-Hour demand Zone that I wanted to to see price initially hold okay I wanted to bid this but the
25:32
fact that we just ripped through this level was wasn't a trigger for me but I
25:37
remember on stream that I think it was last Sunday we around about here this 54k level and I clearly stated I think I
25:45
marked something out like what was it it was probably something along the lines of you can go back and check this free
25:53
it was something along the lines of look if I'm going to get long on this knowing that this is into that key yearly
25:59
mid-level or key demand zone for me the level that has to hold now is this here
26:04
any retests okay of this level and push back Above This is now my invalidation
26:10
point I don't mind price retesting this but we're back inside that key demand Zone we're back inside the range there's
26:17
my swing High to the uh to the um the left range Low Range High that was the
26:23
deviation above it which caused price to come back to the the the 4-Hour demand Zone which failed to
26:29
we got the uh extended selloff shorts piling in at the lows that was good
26:34
enough for me okay liquidations shorts piling at the lows sellers unable to push the market
26:40
they got trapped price on wires back to the highs back to that key level again okay that key pivotal point which is
26:48
62.8 or 62.9 call it give or take 63k all right so that's the context that we
26:54
spoke about that why are we looking for shorts when price has been selling off for the
27:00
last week or so that was on the previous stream and my object my my objective was
27:09
that 61 62k level into the 1225 moving averages essentially where I've taken
27:20
profit what do I think about the yield curve coming out of inversion we'll discuss that on Sunday's stream I just
27:25
want to talk about price action basics now moving forward look
27:30
um the range that I'm looking to play now I'm just going to talk about trade setups here we've been on stream for
27:35
literally 25 minutes time flies right um but essentially this is the range for me
27:41
look it it's this is all I'm looking to trade I'm not even discussing I've never
27:48
once on the timeline mentioned distribution or I think the top is in I I just think it's
27:55
pointless I find that too many people are just trying be heroes in terms of calling a top when there's no real clear
28:01
signs of it being a top especially when you've got equities and NASDAQ rallying higher um to me there's no indications
28:08
or signs of that this is a top or that this is bearish you know in terms of the next several months we're in a Range it
28:14
that's all there is to it we we can't seem to find acceptance below this key level and until that until we do or well
28:21
until we can't then it's very very simple price comes into the range lows I'm looking for Longs give me a pull
28:28
pull back into this level here I'll look for another longer so again taking the midle of this range
28:34
now right we're just in that key
28:45
zone now the key the key Point here is that yes this is still a lower high but
28:52
I think it's probably well documented now on Twitter that you know we're looking for a breaking structure
28:58
possibly a swing High into a higher low I think that could give a very good
29:04
trade setup before we see continuation higher okay that's one
29:09
possibility the second possibility is that we may not even print a new higher high compared to the previous Wing at
29:17
that point so again I think if something like this did play out the question then
29:23
arises EXO would you be looking to short this I'm not sure it depends okay if I see Longs piling in at this level and uh
29:31
shorts getting squeezed out and then Longs get trapped but there's no continuation momentum there's large
29:37
spikes of volume opening up in here but price has been able to push further then yeah I might I may just take a shortterm
29:44
trade back into that 60 61 62k level okay I may do but it's not a high
29:50
priority trade for me I think what makes a more logical setup for me is
29:56
that let's just assume price can not trade up into here okay what do we do then is the crowd now going to turn
30:02
bearish in the in in the assumption that oh no bitcoin's printed another lower high are we going to go even lower down
30:09
which you probably will see some scenarios but for me it's it's a case of
30:16
look if you take the weekly low which is Tuesday and
30:22
the and price was at that 50 57k level look any pullbacks into here for me and
30:31
again if you look at where that is where did price react from back in
30:37
March 1 2 3 4 5 before it traded under
30:43
back Above retested This level and pushed up higher okay and again it's it's contained within the earlier range
30:50
that I talked about that 60k level that's where your moving averages are that 60 61k level this is a key pivotal
30:57
point where price has been tested has tested this level it it's had short LIF
31:02
price action below it before it pushes up higher and again and again okay so any pullbacks now for me into this level
31:10
assuming that we can't take out this high and we get a reaction that's going to be the long stop just below Tuesday's
31:16
low I'm looking for price then to push up into that 68 70k level okay that's
31:22
one scenario the other scenario and again if this happens I'm not looking to short this this is up on the condition
31:28
that we just drift back lower down into this level give a consolidation I'd want
31:33
to see this low hold I don't mind price taking out Tuesday's low and closing back above that key pivotal 60k level or
31:41
back above the bands if it does that then that's going to be a trigger for me to go along looking for higher higher prices at least into 69 70k I I am
31:50
leaning towards the possibility that the price does eventually come back and clean out these highs here you can see where Bitcoin it was being capped at
31:56
this level it never took out this High I think if we do start pushing above the mid level upon a correction that increases the probability for me to
32:03
start trading the upper bound of the range and eventually tagging at least the set of highs that's what I would be
32:09
looking for anyway okay but subjective to data subjecting to trade setups as in when they they come to fruition all
32:16
right so that's a pullback scenario this is the pullback zone that I'm looking for I really wouldn't be contemplating
32:22
shorts I think the the most obvious short for me or the point in terms of um
32:28
having some concern concern in the sense where all right I think we're going to go through a much larger another I
32:34
wouldn't say larger but perhaps another window of correctiv in the market is if we do lose that 59k level then I think
32:41
at that point if we get under here and price cannot seem to find acceptance back over there then you're probably
32:47
thinking to yourself all right we could just tap back into this Zone here and then we'll see where we are okay but
32:53
again not something that I'll be looking to trade I want to remain position and looking for Longs given the the macro
33:00
Outlook the macro context are we heading into a phase of Goldilocks growth is holding up relatively well the FED has
33:07
cut 50 basis point points you know markets have held up fairly fairly well there's still a lot of data to be
33:13
processed I think we'll have a much clearer picture next week so again wre probably will have a stream on Sunday
33:19
heading into tomorrow there's not really a great deal of action that I'll be looking to take you know I've had one
33:25
trade today uh which was a breakout above from um well over the last day
33:30
which was from 62 62 to literally 63.5 which was that mid level where I've
33:35
taken profit now okay I'm not too fussed if price pushes back above here if it does you know all right let's just talk
33:41
about a scenario that I haven't covered which is if price does push above significantly higher then I'm looking
33:46
for that pull back into the mid maybe trades below but as long as price can hold that mid-range level then I'll
33:52
probably start thinking about taking longs to the range highs off the mid okay so that's two long scenarios that
33:58
I'm looking for if and when they do set up and hopefully that should cover the the long scenarios that I'm looking for
34:04
I'm not really looking to entertain shorts no chance okay not the fact not after the fact that we've tested this
34:09
once twice three times um if I see a real structural weakness then maybe I'll start thinking about shorts and if there
34:16
like I said if there is a short that I'm probably going to take as a quick trade if I've got conviction behind it if the
34:21
data tells me y a lot of lungs are trapped up here it's going to be that Spike up into here and a quick reversion
34:27
back into that 61 62k level but again that's just more on my day trading shortterm intraday trading account okay
34:35
I'm still going to maintain some of my spot exposure on bitcoin and just look
34:40
continue looking to hold that for as long as we hold that 52k
34:52
level all right a quick question about the old live streams I need to update them I need to update all the disclaimers um so just a word of warning
34:59
when I republish the old live streams you will get notified that I've released videos but they're actually old videos I
35:05
just want to give a heads up up on that okay right in terms of altcoins we'll
35:10
just quickly touch upon altcoins um again I think I'm going to save that for Sunday but altcoins do look very
35:18
very promising and let's just look at one or two alt coins and we'll take it
35:23
from there but when you see these types of structures right when you look at the monthly time
35:28
frame you've had 1 2 3 4 5 6 months of
35:36
selling into a monthly demand Zone
35:41
okay into what is almost a doy candle taking out the
35:47
previous July low my question to you
35:54
is why would you even be thinking about shorts take them off the table there's no need
36:00
to short this Market at this point in time and if you are shorting then you've got a question your contextual bias why
36:08
are you shorting after price has been down uh trending down for 6 months and
36:13
there's clear signs of exhaustion where are the signs if you look at this on a monthly perspective right purely from a
36:20
price action perspective what is this
36:27
what is this and what is this look at the size of the Wicks
36:34
okay sellers are unable to push the market higher passive buyers are absorbing
36:41
price okay key thing to pay attention to and
36:47
you can in fact take a step back and look at Bitcoin do you or do you not see
36:53
these Wicks okay and I've touched upon this on previous streams look at this rejection rejection sellers stepping
37:00
into the market okay buyers stepping into the market pushing price higher buyers stepping into the market pushing
37:07
price higher What's Happening Here subtleties of price action which
37:14
you should be paying attention to to help you understand based upon the higher time frame what's
37:20
happening in terms of price context so when you look at altcoins
37:29
after months of selling or slow bed lower down we' finally seen some some form of Wicks appearing in the chart now
37:35
look at the weekly this is a downtrend is this now a downtrend or are we now forming the part
37:43
of a range then you can go on The Daily again look at the time and
37:53
price of the chart we've been at these lows
37:58
since July August September two months of price action going sideways in a
38:05
Range by environment look at the size of the candle bodies at the lows very very
38:11
small candle bodies lack of volume lack of sellers now in the market okay for markets to go higher there's got to be a
38:17
lack of selling participants okay and eventually price finds a nice balance of Supply meets demands okay an equilibrium
38:25
point doesn't matter doesn't matter about inverse Head and Shoulders you know just
38:31
pay context to what price is telling you here now based upon these types of
38:36
structures you then have to ask yourself all right when you think of Market Cycles when you think of alt Cycles do
38:43
you really want to be entertaining shorts at these local range highs just so you can trade price a few ticks lower
38:49
down or does it make more sense to wait or start positioning right
38:56
and I and I covered this on a on a tweet earlier that there's two ways I Look to play the market one is from a spot
39:04
positional perspective that's such that when price is has come off a trend
39:09
prints a high prints a low prints under the high we start develop in a Range
39:14
this is no longer a trending Market I want to start positioning from a spot
39:20
perspective into some exposure okay just slowly dollar cost averaging in I'm not
39:25
looking to DCA on the way down I'm looking to DCA in the sideways range
39:31
bound environment knowing that I have a clear inv validation Point knowing that I'm not catching a
39:37
knife now from a futur perspective I want to be trading momentum to the
39:43
upside when price starts breaking out of this range this is when I'll start
39:50
deploying my uh Futures Capital into trades looking for the momentum trade higher knowing that my invalidation is
39:57
should price fail to break out it's going to fall back in the range I've got to look at the trade so now I'm letting my Spot Run Spot positions run okay and
40:05
I'm also Trad in my Futures account looking for maximum gains in the least amount of time at least into this key
40:11
mid level here that's how I'm looking to play the higher time frame I'm just using this one chart as an
40:18
example and that's how I differentiate between playing spots and for those of
40:24
you who wish to play Futures right but you pissing away your capital on funding because you probably bought in here and
40:30
you sat on that position for 30 40 50 days churning out your account through funding well maybe switch over to spot
40:38
and then look for the momentum trade in terms of Futures all right your futures account you're looking for those quick fast momentum plays your spot account
40:45
you can sleep well overnight you're not going to get liquidated you're looking to build a position in a rangeb environment eventually you're looking to
40:52
trade or F in terms of Futures Trading the tail side of that accumulation range that's all there is to it now if you
40:57
want to add context to that again you can use the trend scanners I think that
41:03
it's it's such a great tool for simplification and again can anybody remember what I've preached in the past
41:10
that when you apply moving averages don't just look at Price or the moving averages blindly oh look there's a
41:18
there's a A Bear Cross there's a there's a bull cross what you want to see in an accumulation range is the bands look at
41:25
the trajectory it's going sideways okay Point number one number two is the bands are getting chopped at the highs then
41:33
the lows at the highs then the lows this should help you understand that the
41:38
context has shifted from a trend down into an accumulation range why are you
41:43
looking for shorts when you should start thinking about looking for Longs unless you believe this is
41:48
redistribution which I find hard to believe after a 70 80% retracement the context now is very simple for me I'm
41:55
looking for Longs okay okay I'm looking for positional plays and then when price eventually starts breaking out the range
42:02
I'm not foral wi into spot positions because I'm already trying to build a position around here which I am I'm
42:08
looking to to then let my spot relax once it breaks out I can breathe because
42:15
I've have dollar CL averag around at this level and price starts pushing higher I'm comfortable in my spot plays
42:20
now I can think about trading the market from a Futures perspective and looking to maximize on the trend on the way up
42:27
okay does that make sense and you can keep it very very
42:33
simple extremely simple you you'll probably see many people using um how how I would do it's just
42:40
literally a few lines and um just just understanding what price structures I need to see and look again when you look
42:47
at Price structures right how many Taps of this demand Zone this was the origin for price to go to new all-time highs
42:54
was it not look at the origin which caused price to Trend significantly higher it wasn't just drifting it
43:02
was trending higher okay and again when you look at the inflection points one two three four
43:10
taps into this Zone okay buyers stepping into the market so any pullbacks any
43:16
shallow pullbacks I'm going to keep adding to my save position um and again using the high time frame levels range
43:22
highs mid-range I'm looking to Target that how that plays out I'm not sure but I'm just
43:29
being speculative I don't have no magic wand but I'm looking to play the probabilities if I'm wrong on this
43:35
that's fine I know my invalidation is at 26 if it trades below I have to C the trade for a loss get back above the
43:42
level I step back in building a position hopefully then we'll see the pushup into that 60 60 cents level
43:51
okay bro just say it gigal long now ball run has begun with rate cuts
43:57
yeah of course I mean look I of course I want to be you know super mega bullish but objectively it's not me okay if you
44:06
want opium and people just telling you long the market everything's bullish Q4 is going to be great and I hope it is
44:12
and I hope it will be I'd rather remain level-headed when I'm trading size I'm
44:17
not going to be an absolute turd and just say yep time to go all in just [ __ ] full port into some [ __ ] coins
44:23
and then just um neglect my risk management that's that's not how you survive in this in this game I've
44:29
survived for seven eight years I'm I'm in my heading towards my ninth year of trading you know so risk management is
44:37
what saves my ass all it takes is one bad overly sized position to wipe out my account and I'm never going to let that
44:43
happen okay I will take calculated risks and I will I will not hesitate to cut my
44:49
position if it means waiting for a better probable setup if this is going to come back on me I won't [ __ ] around
44:56
my my language I'll wait for a clearer defined setup maybe this prints a longer
45:02
round at bottom before I can see upside but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to start looking for shorts you
45:08
know look adverse scenario all right maybe this is a failed breakout maybe this isn't quite the time for markets to
45:13
Rally maybe we'll rally after the elections who knows right but I'm just speculating I'm taking on risk I want
45:19
the exposure I I'm pleas the fact that we've we've got this opportunity to start getting exposure at these lows up
45:26
here I was not interested I was not interested in buying spot or having exposure to alt coins down here now that
45:32
the sentiment is crushed and people are crying because they're 70 80% down on their bloody [ __ ] coins well you you've
45:40
only got yourself to self to blame for that okay but for those of you who've been patient in cash looking for
45:47
opportunities I think this is one of those times where over the next two 3 months heading into Q4 you'd like to think this does perform well
45:55
okay and again just keep it really simple you can use a set of moving averages drop down onto the 12h
46:01
hour eventually this will Cascade to the upside and that's when you're going to see your shift and momentum just like
46:07
this that's what you want to see trajectory of the Bands volume picking
46:12
up price candles expanding that's your momentum to go up okay what you're seeing here is in my opinion seller
46:20
exhaustion uh sellers are unable to pull the mar push the market lower down you also have to think about the fact that
46:26
if volume has been low for the again key point just pay very very close attention to this and if you can remember this I
46:33
think you'll do well in your trading career when price has been selling off for several months
46:41
right participants have a lack of in they're disinterested they're not
46:46
interested in in altcoins they've given up all price is down 70% when is this [ __ ] going to turn around okay clearly
46:52
they're not looking to buy because they're back holding number two whoever's puked who whoever have sold is
46:58
pretty much sold out number three when volume is low the books are very very
47:03
thin so when the books are very very thin what do you think happens now I bet
47:10
many of you are looking at this and are are hesitating to buy right which I understand you're probably being
47:16
hesitant should I buy should I not should I buy should I not right and volume is very very low but the books
47:21
are very very thin as well and it's not going to take much for price to print a candle like this which if you look back
47:28
at any previous Cycles or altcoin Cycles or altcoin Seasons you always get that
47:35
strong impulsive first candle which literally wipes out what it wipes out weeks and weeks and weeks of selling in
47:42
one or two Candles now you've got foro now you want to start chasing price and
47:48
on the other hand some people what do they do oh look prices at the range highs let me short the first impulsive move out of this
47:54
range and they haven't paid any any attention to what the context is telling them there's a chance they they
48:02
may get it right and they could fade back inside the range fine but the chances are i' I'd much rather be that
48:08
person who's looking to buy this knowing that this structure is is playing out into an uptrend in the market
48:16
okay the risk with shorting an impulsive move like this is if you're on the wrong side of that and the books are very very
48:23
thin and now the crowd is piling in well price is going to push even higher shorts are going to puke therefore
48:29
pushing price even higher and that's how you often get these fast aggressive moves up it's not just buyers P buyers
48:35
piling in the books are very thin the supply side is very thin shorts are also opening and they're getting absolutely
48:42
[ __ ] rattled out of their position which causes price to go higher understand how markets work under the
48:47
hood especially altcoins when the volume isn't that high and the books are very very thin you're playing a very
48:54
dangerous game if you're trying to short the market from the this positional context that's just my opinion I could
48:59
be wrong but I've been around long enough to understand how to trade altcoins
49:05
okay yeah Saga is a great structures I I think if you pay attention to Saga dime we've been talking about these J curves
49:13
eventually it's starting to pay out again if you look at where the bottom is July August a higher low in September
49:21
look at that this is what you want to be playing you will probably see this type of structure start printing on other
49:28
altcoins okay Saga has been one of the first to move look at this from 80 90 cents off the lows you've got a double
49:36
bottom it's now at $250 that's a 2X straight away under the radar same with
49:42
dime okay dime Saga were coins that I talked about that I'm looking to position into again lovely structure
49:48
right you've got this price trending down look at the moving averages it's compressing it's going sideways this is
49:56
is that contextual shift that I've been talking about this is now where you want to start thinking about accumulating a
50:01
position for those of you who are interested in die I'm not saying go out there and buy it okay and then you're
50:07
looking for that shift in Market structure you're looking for higher highs higher lows the bands trending up
50:13
and now you've got that new wave of cycle pushing higher okay however High it goes but that is value of opportunity
50:21
in terms of trading price to the upside and capturing some of those gains to the upside
50:31
hey Grant how you doing my brother hope you're well so you there's no way right
50:40
that simply put this is opportunity I don't know what else to say to you you've waited for this we've been
50:47
bleeding for 6 months and I don't understand what the pessimism what the fear is about and I've said it on the
50:53
timeline I've not been I've been advocating for the the fact that in terms of macro
50:59
structures this is the [ __ ] that I live for this is exactly what I live for when it comes to trading gos give me this
51:05
every single time and these are some of the best structural setups that you can
51:10
speculate on whether the price goes high is up to the market but I want to speculate on these types of structures
51:16
okay um possibly another one is Wormhole but I'd have to look at the I'd have to look at the supply distribution I I
51:23
don't know what the distribution is like or the token emissions but again another one hovering the lows were at 178 cents
51:30
this is at 22 23 cents there's so many alts like this on centralized exchanges on dexes that you can look at and play
51:38
yes mem coins are doing well once again but eventually I do believe that if Bitcoin does push up to the range highs
51:45
altcoins will hopefully follow suit last chart I'm going to look at is total three I'm not even going to bother
51:50
looking at ethereum at this point but when you look at total 3 when you look at this and the fact that
51:58
again the bounds are compressing but if you look at Price the difference okay
52:04
between distribution and the market being in a bear Trend and me being a
52:09
Perma bear is when you have a clearly defined breaking structure a deviation
52:16
with the bands now it's time to short the market okay all the way down the fact that you've even got a swing High
52:23
deviation that was an easy trade down into this range at this point I don't know if this is going to Trend down it
52:29
could very well continue going higher into a three drivve pattern one two three right what gives it confirmation
52:38
that this is a bare Market is you've got the 1225 weekly death cross you've got
52:45
acceptance above the level but look what happened it's shortlived once it gets under the bands under this ksr level
52:52
there's your trigger to short absolutely floor it to the next logical support level
52:57
close your trade okay now when you look across the line why is this different
53:03
well first of all we've been going sideways or drifting lower for 6 months
53:09
that's your highs in April March okay we're now heading into October Q4
53:16
secondly price has been holding up a support here we've already had one
53:21
instance of price trading above the 12 and the 21
53:29
it's had three tests of support very similar to bitcoin why are you looking to show altcoins when there's a very
53:35
good chance that if this does break out of this trend line and above the 12 uh
53:41
1225 weekly EMAs into Q4 surely the probability was of The
53:49
Upside versus the downside key word probability then if you look at the
53:54
stock RSI which is one of my favor fa indicators in terms of timing momentum cover this numerous times on
54:03
stream the fact that the stock RSI was in oversold territory for 6 months and
54:11
yet all price could do is retrace 40 50% that to
54:16
me from past experience is indicative of a corrective move as opposed to a
54:23
Distributive move okay yes altcoins across the board of gone down 60 70 80%
54:28
but the point I'm trying to make is structurally this looks okay it's it's
54:34
it's pull back into a level of efficiency into what was a logical level
54:39
of support consolidation price ried higher slow drift down into that level
54:44
can't break through it weekly sock RSI is now at the lows looking to turn back
54:50
up momentum is starting to pick up across markets you really want to start thinking about
54:56
trading momentum to the upside for as long as this key level holds okay and
55:02
that's why I'm excited heading into Q4 if that things can come if the market does come into fruition like I
55:09
anticipate like I hope um I just don't see the point in in really looking for short opportunities when I think the
55:16
upside and the risk reward favors upside risk and gaining exposure building
55:22
positions for the opportunity over the coming weeks now now the caveat to all of this is that Bitcoin is heading into
55:29
a level of resistance at 65 at 66k should Bitcoin give a pullback
55:36
to 62k then altcoins will give a pullback as long as Bitcoin holds at
55:41
1225 or 1221 EMA I'd like the idea of positioning or
55:46
increasing exposure next week or the next week or two into alt coins from a spot perspective I'll have my Futures
55:53
account ready to start latching onto the momentum play okay but that's it for today's stream I've
55:59
probably well wow it's been 1 hour time flies but I'm just trying to really keep
56:04
it very simple in terms of pure price action thinking about markets from a contextual perspective we can touch
56:11
touch upon all the fancy indicators and open interest and Delta or and orderflow I'm watching the tape in latest streams
56:17
but I just want you to understand that look at the opportunity the potential opportunity ahead of you okay that's my
56:25
key Point here and that's the key point of this of today's stream that there's no need to be fearful in the markets
56:32
um remove your emotional bias think logically from a risk to reward
56:37
perspective and look at what's ahead of you in terms of price okay that's all for me have a great Friday and a weekend
56:46
and hopefully I'll catch you guys um possibly Sunday evening with with
56:52
more of a macro outlook on bitcoin create setups but like I said I think over the next next day so I probably
56:58
won't be trading much going to be take it easy and um like I said bitcoin's coming into an area of contention of
57:03
slight level of resistance nothing that concerns me you have to remember we've moved off 52 into 64 potentially
57:12
65 and um yeah we could squeeze higher if people are trying to short this too early might just push up higher before
57:19
we then get a correction but I think it's that corrective move then where you've got to thought start thinking
57:24
about all right which altcoins have shown strength and is Bitcoin going to respect that key level of 60 59 to 60k
