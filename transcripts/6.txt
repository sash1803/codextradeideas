hey what's up people should be
0:15
live are we all doing
0:21
good just give me a quick confirmation in the chat that you can see my screen and that you can hear my audio all loud
0:29
and clear here [Music]
0:49
please all right awesome what a day what a start of the week a big bunch of
0:56
liquidations we'll discuss that shortly on stream today but um as always a
1:02
special thank you to OK exchange for once again sponsoring the Bitcoin market review it
1:08
is the 9th of December 2024 the time is just after 10 p.m.
1:15
UTC and as always nothing in this video constitutes Financial advice it is just my view of
1:22
the market how I'm looking to trade the market and just sharing tidbits of
1:28
knowledge here and there okay so we'll just without further Ado we'll kick off
1:33
on today's stream let's jump straight into it what do we
1:40
think 1.58 billion worth of Liquidations in
1:45
the last 24 hours of which the large majority were Longs
1:51
okay crazy crazy people longing into resistance ethereum traded from 2200s
1:59
into 4 ,000 same with Bitcoin at the range highs people opening large Longs
2:04
same on altcoins so I feel as though we were overdue a corrective move at some
2:10
point it's what I alluded to on the timeline yesterday when I posted my
2:15
chart I saw ethereum trading the range highs literally to to the swing of the
2:22
Range High and and that for me was good enough to take profit okay and I was looking for that correction whether that
2:28
meant another move higher before we see a pullback and um and here we have it we've had $1 1.5 billion worth of
2:36
liquidations obviously liquidation data is never accurate as far as I'm concerned but from the information that
2:42
we do have available at our disposal we can assume that there there's a fairly
2:48
good deal average in event that occurred today okay so you can see in the last hour alone 59 million Longs got
2:54
liquidated last 12 hours over a billion dollars last four hours okay this is where the bulk of the move happened that
3:01
$1 billion liquidation Mark now that we've discussed that and got that out
3:07
the way uh I know there's going to be some questions about hey EXO uh what's happening with the group just hold fire
3:15
I've been trying to sort out a couple of technical issues with the team now just ah heads up what's the
3:21
plans for the next few weeks I shall be streaming after today I think I've got
3:26
another stream maybe later this week on Friday and then the last one for the month will
3:32
be next Monday Tuesday and that's it I'm I'm I'm calling it a day on streaming for this side of the year and then
3:39
you'll probably catch me back on the stream I guess on probably Sunday the
3:45
5th or sometime before that okay so just two more streams after this and then I'll be taking
3:51
a kind of a break from stream let's just say right looking at the high time frame
3:56
chart nothing surprises me with Bitcoin I've I've told talked about the fact that you know expect plenty of chop and
4:04
consolidation expect expect plenty of rangeb price action um not convinced obviously more
4:13
so today than ever before that we're ready for a breakout and we'll dive into that but what is key for me is and if
4:21
you recall from last week's stream when we had several weeks of price action
4:26
trading higher we had assume let me zoom in into the chart can you guys see my
4:32
screen okay I just want to make sure everything is working fine I've had to move a few things around today so kind
4:38
of lost my settings but um EXO sounds n no I'm not nervous I've just um just
4:44
fairly I've been up since 5:00 this morning to be honest with you as I am most days so um wouldn't say i s
4:52
nervous should I be nervous if I am nervous why why would I be nervous
5:01
okay so we had this as a previous High one two three weeks of Correction fourth
5:07
week pushing got fifth week breakout but if you look at the candle bodies and look at the Wicks on the either side of
5:13
price okay I'm still leaning towards this kind of probable scenario that we
5:20
may see one push higher at some point later in January or December I'm not
5:25
sure just yet so again looking at Price here we are still respecting the 96 95k level
5:34
it's holding okay as far as I'm concerned can we see a deeper pullback yes we absolutely can now just a couple
5:41
of points I'm going to keep this as a very short stream because I'm absolutely [ __ ] today I'm shattered but looking
5:47
at the daily stock
5:52
RSI yeah not using these colors just one second
6:00
so looking at the daily stock RSI sorry that's the weekly looking at the daily
6:06
we had somewhat bottomed as I'd hoped round about on the 7th of December and I
6:11
if you recall I did say it generally takes about a good 10 days if if you look at historical context at the
6:17
previous times the daily soccer RSI has bottomed this was between the 1st and 2nd of October started oscillating high
6:24
around about the 12th 13th same again in September so you always get that one period in a month where where the daily
6:31
stock in a decent Market environment generally bottoms out for a period of 10
6:38
days are we getting something here similar or is this going to be slightly prolonged okay before we start seeing
6:43
price oscillate back to the highs that's kind of the scenario that I'm looking for so for me for until that happens and
6:49
again looking at Price here I'm still in the belief that this is somewhat range
6:54
bound is price action I still can't decide whether this is going to be Trend
7:01
continuation compression into expansion or whether we get a deeper pullback into that 85k level if you saw the fractal
7:09
that I posted on Saturday I think it was Saturday or Friday that should give you an idea of um what I'm keeping in the
7:17
back of my mind let's just put it that way was there anybody here who didn't see the fractal that I posted on the
7:23
timeline on Friday but if you haven't let me know we can
7:28
cover that scenario sorry very quickly it was essentially something similar to this here where perhaps let's
7:37
just go perhaps let's just go into a different time uh different chart I should say
7:45
coinbase in the context of price looking at this okay we had this
7:52
grind up expansion higher price trading within this range okay we had
8:00
one push above the level let me do that
8:10
again slows me down when I lose all when I lose all my settings but here we are
8:15
okay so this was a previous Range High this was my significant lows over here
8:20
what did price do in in that range it traded both sides of the range before we
8:25
saw continuation higher and this was a trend in Market back into a range this traded in this period for the best part
8:33
of December printed the lows into January 6 weeks later before continuation higher
8:40
and as you can see very similar we had price trade above the highs Consolidated
8:45
flushed all the way down push back to the highs flushed all the way back down traded the lows before it continued
8:51
higher are we going to see something similar to that the key answer to that question all depends upon the mid-range
8:59
here okay if price can respect the mid-range considering where we are and
9:06
we see price respect the trend line then I would lean to the possibility or the
9:11
probability that look over the coming weeks we're probably going to see compression into some form of expansion
9:17
if however we lose the trend line we consolidate below the trend line as a
9:23
form of resistance then we break down below the mid then I think the probability is that we would take out
9:29
the lows very similarly as to what we've seen here now note that the liquidations
9:34
at this point were very very high now today if you look at what we've had in the market we've had an extreme fairly
9:41
large amount of liquidations could there be more yes potentially could this drift lower down before finding support
9:47
absolutely but again when you look at the price price structure similarities price range bound breaks
9:54
into a trend drifts higher forms a Range High
10:06
okay and then you've got the range lows equally down around about 85 86k so the
10:11
question I'm asking is all right look you know this isn't surprising to me that we've seen choppy price action
10:18
after a significant rally over the last several weeks since the 5th of November 6th of November so the question is is
10:25
this going to respect the trend line or is this going to continue breaking down slowly bleeding lower
10:33
consolidation and then another move down taking out these lows here I don't know is the only sster but I'm I'm hopeful
10:41
and optimistic that if you look at the BuyBacks for now okay look at this look at this look at this Weck here we're
10:47
filling a lot of this in efficiency today with today's liquidations we've just had a large number of liquidations
10:52
so is there any fuel left for this to really break below the mid level I'm not too sure okay but one thing I am towards
11:00
is the fact that maybe over the coming day or two that we will see price gradually drift
11:07
lower into some sort of Bas likee structure that's what I want to see at the very
11:13
minimum okay just to do that again I want to see some form of structure coming into the mid level in fact I have
11:20
a chart elsewhere
11:35
so here's a chart I've already got ready okay so you can see we're trading at the monthly open level I think if we start
11:41
getting getting acceptance below the monthly open level then the big question
11:47
for me is okay I don't mind that it it's it's within a range at the end of the
11:53
day or a candidate of being in a Range it's not confirmed because we are still
11:59
making piing higher highs and higher lows okay in terms of price closes so the question is if we do trade lower
12:05
down and don't forget this fomc on Wednesday so I think for whatever reason there'll be a level of hedging people
12:12
covering uh in terms of taking shorts okay so don't be surprised if those
12:17
positions get Unwound after Wednesday post fomc I think it's highly likely
12:23
that we will see another 25 basis point uh rate uh 25 basis point rate cut and
12:28
at that point the question is will markets catch a bid okay so for me just seeing this consolidation down here into
12:34
something like this I would certainly take a stab longing this okay with a clear invalidation below here okay
12:41
there's a previous demand Zone price has retested it once retested it twice I don't really want to see it come below
12:48
this point here sorry this point here where where the bottom of this yellow boxes because if it does then I I think
12:56
structurally unless it's a fast reclaim back above the mid level then I think there's a decent chance I
13:02
may get to Long price from down here and if that is the case if we do trade the r
13:07
range lows I don't think we just break down and that's it I think we we will certainly spend a significant amount of
13:14
time trading this range back and forth over the next several weeks which is ideal for altcoins okay you want to see
13:21
Bitcoin find a level of support alts start catching a bit again
13:27
ethereum catches a bit whilst bit Bitcoin finds or establishes a level of
13:32
support Bitcoin volatility is fairly reduced you've seen today as an example as to what happens when Bitcoin starts
13:38
breaking down on this low bleed alts get impacted alts eventually because of the
13:44
high open interest I think it was something like $7 billion on open interest on altcoin so you know people
13:50
chasing the highs the time to position was many several months ago several weeks ago 5th of November even before
13:56
that I've not been trading any coins on Leverage I've been positioned in spot
14:02
and today was another reason perhaps why you know if you're looking to swing trade and spot trade and and and play
14:08
those positions for 2 three months you really don't need to be touching leverage and holding a position for two three months if you're looking to take
14:16
momentum based trades that are probably going to last between 1 hour to 2 3 days
14:21
fine that probably makes more sense in terms of switching to purpose of Futures
14:27
so that's kind of where my view is I still think that inevitably Bitcoin will trade lower down into this level then
14:34
we'll see what happens any
14:41
questions and as far as I'm as far as I'm what I'm doing I'm I'm not really doing a great deal right now I'm just
14:47
waiting for price to to show well in all honesty um I'm already hedged from 102s
14:52
okay so the Hedge that I took from 99 over here I cut that out uh before the
14:59
move up in fact I was talking about it in stream when we saw price closing back above the monthly and I said clearly
15:05
said on stream that I probably need to get out very very soon because this looks like it's going to go higher
15:12
but getting out I wouldn't consider a profit or a win just getting out more or
15:18
less close to break even price Trad of the highs I saw a reason to short okay
15:26
um this for me the reason why I shorted this last week or yeah it was last week
15:31
simply because this move up was just basically shorts getting liquidated shorts closing out Longs opening at this
15:38
level and what happened they got flushed okay so for now I am still hedged from 102s against my entire spot holding on
15:47
bitcoin um and ideally I'm looking for a reason to close out that hedge short
15:52
okay it's not a directional short it's not an outright short it just gives me
15:58
cover from from my purchases from down here at 53 54 55 I've got a a spot
16:06
average price of 54k from down here so that position that I'm running is not a
16:11
directional sh it's just a hedge against locking in those gains without having to
16:17
sell my spot position there's been some confusion that people assume that I that I've switched short or that I'm bearish
16:23
bearish but um uh I'll I'll know the time I'll see the signs when I need to
16:28
be bearish but it's just not here okay this is just short-term price action very choppy within a range if it is a
16:35
range or if this is still Trend continuation it remains to be seen let
16:40
me just have a quick look through the
16:48
questions am I down on any of my spot positions or no I've been buying spot off the lows look I boughta at 22 23
16:55
cents I bought C at 23 24 cents bought vanry at the laws again um all the
17:01
positions that I bought guys even the ones that I shared like uh Tai that was
17:07
down at 12 cents um anyone if you remember I covered anyone that was down
17:13
at $1 so a lot of my positions are up significantly you know I bought anyone
17:18
down here at this $1 level so yeah it's breaking down not ideal but at the end
17:25
of the day price has gone from 70809 ents a dollar to $240 I have to expect some level of a 30
17:34
40% correction any deeper than you know maybe alarm Bell start ringing but
17:39
looking at this that that's a 30% correction if this is going to pull back and assume that Bitcoin right if I if I
17:47
assume that Bitcoin is likely to trade into these lws then I think you will see a fairly deeper correction on altcoins
17:54
but if Bitcoin can show strength and hold this level here here ultimately
18:00
that 90 to 92k level and it can give me a a some form of a bottoming
18:06
structure along with the stock RSI resetting on The
18:12
Daily and I'll talk about the RSI next as well cuz that's something that I use in these instances if I can see a
18:18
structure like this then it's game on okay if you look at the stock RSI on the
18:24
4H hour it's at the bottom if you look at the stock on the 12h hour it's it's nearing its bottom if you look at the
18:31
daily it's already oscillated at the lows it may come back down one more time before pushing back higher price is
18:37
still steadily holding this level or trend
18:42
line for now okay so I'm not too concerned if you look at the weekly I talked about the weekly yes it's killing
18:48
over but you can see the weekly many instances where price has often traded
18:54
the highs in a ball Market tra price trades down the rsr
19:01
remains overbought so whether we see a small drop and it pushes back up again
19:06
that's what leads me to believe that we could see a probable second leg if there is going to be a second leg higher okay
19:14
but for now for me this is just shy positioning people buying in at the highs getting absolutely rinsed not once
19:21
but twice so until they finally give their positions and eventually short
19:26
start Ping in then the one side or another is going to have to give in okay so we'll just have to wait and
19:40
see so for now nothing really exciting happen happening and I don't think
19:46
anything significant will happen in the next few days certainly not until post
19:52
FMC I'm leaning towards potentially um
20:03
next week been an interesting week for Bitcoin and the market heading into Christmas week and into January we'll
20:10
see what we get right let's move on to the
20:26
RSI oh dear never um never wish to lose your settings
20:32
before a stream it's a pain in the off really is right okay let's start off on
20:38
the weekly still has room to go higher in my opinion rolling over slightly but still
20:45
if you look at previous cycle tops December 20 uh 28th of December at the
20:52
highs and price still went higher this was in March 2024 so nothing really I can gaug from there the daily is the one
20:59
that I'm interested in I I feel as though looking at Price
21:05
here and looking at the daily RSI I want to see this come lower down into this 50
21:14
level and hold okay price coming down into this midrange and holding if for whatever
21:22
reason we get a deeper pullback then expect the RSI to trade back well to oscillate back to its low and where upon
21:31
each instance when that has happened it's generally been a good buying opportunity so you can see that's here
21:37
you can see that's over here as well you always get a nice reaction when the RSI
21:42
is at the lows or alternatively in an uptrend when it pulls back into that 50
21:48
level okay the 50 level and then price breaks higher so just something I'm looking to time in terms of Confluence
21:56
I'm just waiting for the RSI to to to push lower down let Bitcoin consolidate
22:01
build a base build a structure before we see some level of continuation higher
22:06
okay if you look on the 4H
22:20
hour near ring its slows okay so we're at 30 39s could come down into 30s again
22:28
that's generally been a sweet spot in terms of the uh the 4H hour okay so just something to watch out for maybe we want
22:35
to see price again I keep talking about price building a Basel likee structure before we see some form of reversal
22:42
maybe higher okay but it is going to be choppy it certainly will be choppy so I'm only looking to trade Bitcoin at the
22:48
extremes or at the mid-ranges that's it for me nothing
22:57
more I'm not going to C altcoins today guys because um I just want to keep this
23:02
a short stream the main emphasis is Bitcoin ethereum we'll look at total two total 3 and we'll move on right talking
23:09
about heat Maps look at this remember the levels that we covered last
23:15
week there were two levels that I marked out on stream one was the 85k level and the
23:23
other one was the 90 to 92k level price trades in there Ries higher okay shorts
23:31
puke long Pile in Delta unwind slam straight into those bids and bounce
23:38
aggressively higher so there's quite a large number
23:45
of orders in the books obviously they can get pulled at any one time but what you really want to be seeing or
23:52
observing is the volume increasing into those passive bids and price absorbing
23:58
any aggressive cells late shorts piling in to a key level of demand and when you
24:06
see those shorts opening into demand but they are unable to push price any lower
24:11
down it's only a matter of time before once their offside they puke their positions you get that Delta rwind and
24:18
then price reverts quickly back to the upside again okay that's what you want to be looking for so again looking at
24:24
the books here all the way down to 89 90,000 you know there's quite a fair amount of
24:31
uh bids stacked there in terms of price okay so again I'm just watching for this level if it trades and and that's why I
24:39
said I don't want to see price essentially trade trade below the mid level okay if you recall what I said on
24:46
the chart let me just re reverse everything that I've just
24:52
done okay this is what I'm alluding to that same level that I've
24:59
kept on my chart that he map level I've I've clearly stated on stream that
25:04
ideally I don't want to see price trade below this level I don't mind price coming into this level basing out and
25:11
then pushing away but any lower than that then I have to be open to the
25:18
probability that we we could see price trade at the range lows which is an even
25:23
better opportunity as far as I'm concerned to Long Bitcoin and at that point I absolutely will close my uh
25:29
shorts out okay and just continue riding my spot Longs looking for a bounce from that
25:36
position evening all and any latecomers I just want to keep things
25:43
very simple very simplistic you know um focusing on price
25:48
action emphasizing the key points that I look at looking at the heat Maps where
25:53
it makes sense and why looking at liquidations can price
25:59
continue you know forcing its way down and if we've had 1.5 billion worth of
26:05
liquidations then you know this has been bought up fairly quick so it's really really
26:11
encouraging to see and I I I I would just like to get fomc is on Wednesday isn't it I I I can't recall of I think
26:19
it is on Wednesday isn't it or is it next week let me check
26:37
ah it's the CPI day on Wednesday so fomc is the I've been saying fomc Wednesday so that's going to be the week after
26:43
isn't it yeah it's next Wednesday it's on the 17th yeah that's what I thought I was
26:48
thinking why am I saying um fomc it's CPI data fomc I think is on is on the
26:53
17th or 18th next week so Wednesday is the CPI data my bad apologies correction
27:00
on stream it's what happens when you've been awake for like silly silly hours nearly 18 hours with no sleep so here we
27:06
are straight to bed after this one right okay so we're all good yeah time to move
27:13
on E usct again into the level that I mapped
27:18
out on the timeline doesn't surprise me what I need to see here is price respect
27:29
this key mid zone between these two regions okay this was a consolidation
27:35
price rallied off the lows consolidation continuation
27:40
higher into the range highs that was a reason for me to take profit straight
27:46
back into this key level of demand okay ultimately there's two levels that I'm
27:53
looking for here this is a significant level at 34s okay 34 35 is one level the
28:01
other level that I want to see hold is just down here and that is the level between 34
28:10
and 32 they are the two zones that I would like to see hold it's either one of
28:15
these where I feel like if ethereum is likely to go higher then it would have
28:21
to be from one of these two zones
28:26
okay the question
28:31
is how much time is it going to take to consolidate is it going to be here or is it going to push one leg lower down and
28:38
then continuation higher there're the two scenarios that I'm looking for if for whatever reason price trades below
28:44
this mid level and gets acceptance retests the underside and rolls over then we've got bigger problems much much
28:51
bigger problems okay then I would be concerned but for now I think after what
28:58
we've seen is a very extensive move from 2200 into
29:04
4,000 this has not come as any surprise to me okay late Longs piling into
29:10
resistance they're going to get washed out highly leverage Traders looking to seek to trade price higher they've got
29:17
rinsed out of the market okay so now what I'm looking for over the next 3 4
29:22
days is a corrective phase a consolidation phase a b like structure
29:28
before we see continuation higher and again if you look at the daily stock RSI one thing I've said time and time
29:35
again that generally when we are in this macro range bound type of
29:41
environment I would feel much more comfortable longing ethereum once this
29:47
can oscillate to the downside and again I think that's this is going to take a good several days before we see price
29:53
oscillate to the lows and then start pushing up higher so how long is that going to take I'm not too sure how deep
29:58
is the correction likely to be is it going to be 30 uh 35s or is it going to be 32s that's what you have to figure
30:07
out if price trades those levels how are you looking to trade those levels if you've understood everything I've taught
30:15
you over the years okay if for whatever reason I decide to take a
30:21
trigger there's my trigger there's my stop and price can't seem to continue pushing higher and it's coming back into
30:27
price I will cut that trade because I'm looking to play the probability that okay Point number one I either get to
30:34
long this level now and it goes higher or I wait for
30:40
price to trade in Norman's land in this zone between this block or or this
30:46
demand Zone and then start pushing higher again basically running the previous stops I'll jump back into price
30:52
uh jump back into the trade looking for it to trade higher okay that's the two triggers that I'm looking for is that
31:04
clear there we go the C uh call CPI on Wednesday so I'd expect a level of uh
31:10
unwinding to happen with with this data but the big one is next week with the
31:15
fomc so hopefully once that's out of the way we can um get a good good reaction in the market uh
31:24
after fomc which which kind of lines up I think if we are going to see a corrective phase for the next week or so then maybe this is what we need to see
31:31
in the market before we see prices continue trading higher
31:37
okay final note um on this chart
31:47
is okay zooming out now let's just take the 3-day view don't lose sight of the bigger
31:53
picture look at this okay this is our previous range Highs at 4,000 something
32:00
I'm still of the opinion that we will come and trade this high or that's what
32:06
my expectation is whether that happens my I only know as much as you guys okay I don't hold a crystal ball but that's
32:12
what I'm trading towards that's what I'm playing towards I'm not looking for any shorts on ethereum I'm purely looking
32:19
for long opportunities I'm looking to reposition back into my spot position I
32:24
sold 2/3 at 38 39 and 400 so I'm looking to rebuild the spot position that I had
32:31
okay after taking significant profits if I see a reason to do so so this is a significant high that I believe that we
32:38
could see price trade over the coming weeks okay and then in terms of the immediate lows it's this level here look
32:46
how clean prices respect to this significant swing Point Not only was it
32:52
a level of resistance resistance support support okay take the mid of this
33:00
level leaves you at
33:07
where just over here okay give or take now what I normally do here is is draw
33:13
two zones sometimes kind of a zonal level and if you look at where price has traded today
33:19
where has it traded straight into if you just into the mid
33:25
of the the zone that I've just marked out but not only into the mid of that zone also into what into the mid of if I just
33:35
remove the two blue lines remember what we had there's our Range High there's our range low there's
33:42
our mid level there's our range quarter confluent with the high higher time
33:47
frame mid level so this is an example what I've shown you of how I use a range
33:54
within a bigger higher time frame range okay that's how I use a range within a range
34:01
and it adds a lot of Confluence at that 35 3400
34:06
level one more point I'd like to show you
34:13
is let's look at
34:20
ethereum let's order this group this by 100 look how thick the books are stacked
34:26
as long as the bids are get pulled and we see absorption at this 34 3,300
34:39
level okay look at where prices reacted
34:45
from there's the there's a big stack of passive bids resting in the books
34:52
there 3600 36 3550 35 34
34:58
3400 okay as the biggest node where's
35:03
3,400 on the
35:10
chart right there okay that's the level that I want
35:15
to see hold and if you look at Price here as well we've only just
35:21
traded this previous swing low here taken it out and traded back above it so if there is if there is a retracement
35:30
over the coming days okay this is a fairly reactive balance okay possibly
35:36
shorts closing some profits people buying uh
35:41
getting their bits fill but if we see price trade into this Zone
35:49
here and you see a bottoming structure that's what I'd be looking for in terms of trend continu now that could take a
35:55
few days at least it may take a week several days 8 Days 9 days okay everything that I look at again is
36:02
trading about is is about trading your probabilities trading with mechanical oscillators trading into key levels I
36:09
want to trade okay waiting for the right price structures so I can get into a trade I'm not looking to knife catch
36:14
this I was never looking to knife catch this for those of you who are asking me ex did you get in today did you leave
36:20
bids no I didn't okay I'd much rather let price show me a structure
36:26
that I want to trade versus throwing a bunch of uh limit bids in here and
36:31
hoping that they get filled it's not how I trade most of the time okay unless I've got a very very high conviction
36:38
that this is going to be the level to hit I still feel as though there's plenty of time before you know we could
36:43
see we could see I'm not saying we will see we could see price drift down lower down one more time before we see price
36:50
trading higher and again when you look at ethereum on the higher time frame it shouldn't come as a surprise
36:58
okay we we've had an extensive move up you want to see when price pushes when
37:03
price trades higher okay you want to see some level of Correction like this and
37:09
then continuation higher again okay this type of structure in fact salana had it if you look at the salana
37:15
chart back in 2021 you get these deep Corrections
37:21
continuation higher now this is what I've had marked out on my salana chart I'm not I've not been talking about long
37:28
in this we finally got the pull back into this level I think we see something very similar to this okay I'm looking
37:36
for one more push higher on salana it may take a few days if you look at how
37:42
many days this took one okay from the highs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 then
37:53
we got expansion 14 okay consolidation ational building a base then we saw the
38:01
directional move higher where are we right now we've had 1 2 3 4 5 67 half of what this is here so again it
38:09
shouldn't come as a surprise and I'm just saying just try to think of scenarios that if we are to consolidate
38:16
here for another week so what it's fairly healthy what you don't want to see is a very deep correction breaking
38:23
back into this previous composite or this previous range that's where I would start questioning
38:30
the market like okay if we are in a trended market what the [ __ ] are we doing back inside of a range having
38:36
spent the best part of 6 months trading within that range only to
38:42
break above and then get back inside that's not very allseason like as far as I'm concerned okay so at the very
38:50
deepest point I don't mind if price comes back and trades into 190s but
38:56
ideally that 200 level is what I've tweeted about I want to see price respect this 200 level I don't want to
39:03
see any significant closes and continuation below this level that then
39:08
gives me confidence that right we're building a Basel likee structure we should see continuation higher again
39:14
look at the stock RSI I bet it's oscillating to the lows yes it is that's on the 3-day look at the daily
39:20
oscillated at the lows bounced up it's probably going to come back down again and then we can get that push up higher
39:26
okay so that's kind of what I'm looking at look at the RSI same again this is on the daily it's
39:34
broken below the 50 level so the question is does this trade back at the
39:39
lows even better we've had a a full reset on The Daily RSI and hopefully
39:45
price is respecting this level here that to me is a fairly shallow corrective like consolidation before we see the
39:52
next leg higher okay where my Cal concern is is a break back in side of
39:58
this
40:06
range right let's move on to eth
40:12
BTC looks fine to me no problems you can't expect price after bleeding for
40:19
months and months and months right to just simply in one candle go back up this
40:26
looks to me correct Ive this looks to be a highly probable bottom before we see a
40:34
reversal like structure and then continuation
40:41
higher okay that's what I'd want to see so this
40:46
this looks fine to me this looks okay it may take a bit of time but it's shaping up very nicely
40:57
right let's look at
41:05
total doesn't look good I understand but you know we've just broken out of the
41:12
previous high so if we do happen to get a retest you
41:19
know if we are to go higher
41:26
and and if that means having a a a retest into this Zone here i' take that
41:32
any day just think of this as one big range price trades out of the range
41:40
gives a retest and then continues higher I'd happily take that that could
41:46
take a month or so okay it could be January where alts really take off so again just something to bear in mind
41:52
that a pull back into that3 trillion doll level isn't isn't isn't Doom
41:57
it's just a welcome pullback as long as it holds
42:03
that structure and we see continuation higher so try to envisage what those
42:10
structures would look like and secondly if you look at
42:17
this we've had one 2 3 four five weeks of upwards
42:26
price action and this is the first corrective week that we've
42:31
had maybe we get one more push down next week and that is the down candle before
42:38
we see price going higher so think of it as a spring if it is going to go higher
42:43
then hopefully that's the push back before we go higher okay but essentially you want to see the $3 trillion level
42:54
hold will this be my last cycle I I'm not going nowhere [ __ ] that I'm I'm always going to be trading I didn't
43:01
sacrifice 7 eight years of emotional trauma to get to where I am so is this
43:06
going to be my last cycle no bollocks anybody who says that is chatting [ __ ] they'll always come back once you're in
43:12
this face it's hard to get out unless you know for whatever reason you you've
43:17
had a bad run and you're mentally struggling then then I understand why people would quit but then you wouldn't
43:23
spend eight eight years or nine years of your life trading with you just just to call it a a so I'll always be trading it
43:30
just probably probably means that I'll be making more positional trades as as opposed to trading actively some more
43:36
one of those like three to five trades a year big big trades that's what I'd be looking
43:44
for I'm [ __ ] going
43:50
nowhere all this [ __ ] talk man I think it's just attention seeking after this cycle that's it I'm going no you're not
43:56
you can go [ __ ] nowhere you're staying in the trenches with me that's it you're stuck for
44:11
life all right that's total look let's look at total
44:17
two so total two just fell short of the
44:24
highs just fell short of the highs
44:35
here nice flush down into that demand first significant demand Zone there okay
44:42
would you agree this was the consolidation before we saw price continue
44:50
higher that's okay that's fine cons consolidation and then hopefully we get
44:55
continuation higher
45:01
very similar to what we've had here look if I probably lean towards this [ __ ] here look if you get the replay tool
45:09
out all right okay fair enough no replay on this symbol but look this is your up
45:15
move uh you had cons Trend Trend Trend Trend Trend pull back consolidation
45:21
price R is higher pulls back into this level spends the best part of 1 2 3 4 5
45:27
6 7 8 9 10 days continuation higher okay so will we see something similar I
45:34
hope so total
45:39
three same again it's just looking at the same chart demand Zone consolidation
45:46
if you look at the uh Fib from the from the um from the low to
45:54
the high there's your 0. five there's nothing wrong with that this is
46:00
what you want to see hold and then continuation higher it takes time guys
46:05
not everything is going to go up in one line look at previous Cycles it's done
46:11
it every time you always get these 30 40% flushes in in price where price trends higher you get a Shar pullback
46:18
several days8 days 9 10 days of consolidation and the rip side everybody's happy again okay so it
46:24
happened in 2017 and if you look at when it happened it happened in um 18th 19th Christmas week
46:32
before we took off into January and that was the top first week of January okay so happened in 2017 happened again in
46:40
2021 look at this February the price Ries to four
46:46
490 billion flushes down into 300 billion consolidates for several days
46:52
continuation higher look at the continuation structures that's why I keep drawing the structure look price
46:58
pushes up gets flushed consolidates and then
47:04
continuation higher remember that trend line pattern okay something similar to
47:11
that that's where you want to be looking for positioning back into price as long
47:17
as the structure on the left
47:23
holds then we have with this
47:29
God I hate streaming I hate streaming when I lose all my chart settings oh this fairly brutal pullback
47:37
you know 450 billion down to 330
47:45
billion into this ksr if I had to guess I I bet this is a
47:53
range quarter let's just find out
47:59
range lows range
48:06
highs mid-range is around about there give or
48:20
take yep there's a mid okay that's a mid-range so I've just blocked it off
48:26
then take Tak the mid to to5 there's your midrange there
48:33
okay just the into the 618 so give a take um into this level
48:44
here give or take
48:59
all right so again just looking for some form of support to be established over the coming days you're looking for
49:06
corrective consolidation patterns this is not going to be reverse back up in one day it will take several days at the
49:13
very least okay this is significant correctives like structure you want to see something like
49:20
this and then continuation higher hopefully below here we'll we'll revisit that scenario if we start breaking below
49:26
here then we then we have a bigger problem on our hands okay I don't know when the top will be
49:33
Cil I don't know but I I what you'll find is
49:38
look it's not about timing the top it's about scaling on the way out being
49:44
comfortable with profits and being comfortable with taking profits you can't wait for these 203 40% flushes and
49:52
then say to yourself [ __ ] why didn't I take profit it's too late you've got to have a plan on the way
49:58
up for me it's not about naming the top for me it's about drisking on the way up
50:03
just like I've done with ethereum right I tweeted about this that I've been trading ethereum
50:09
from I bought ethereum here bought ethereum here bought ethereum here 2300s 2250s 23s was my average entry I cashed
50:17
out here I cashed out most of it on the over the weekend then we get the flush
50:22
okay now I'm in I'm playing from a position of strength like okay where can I now buy back into
50:28
the market I've got two choices I can either buy back above the range highs because I'm looking to trade price
50:35
towards the highs or I can potentially buy this structure here if it holds or
50:41
if that fails cut my position buy this here I get to I get to trade price higher again okay so I've already locked
50:48
in the gains most of the gains that I've caught from here selling here is not the end of the
50:53
world for me people will oh EXO you're going to miss out on the on on alt
50:59
season because you've taken profit anybody who comes out with [ __ ] like that clearly doesn't miss on trading and
51:04
it tells you a lot about who they are as a Trader they have no conception of managing uh no idea of
51:13
of of concept of managing risk okay and how to play the
51:18
probabilities and that's why you should understand as a Trader there's always a way to get back in back on board of a
51:25
trade don't worry about what people say oh you you've missed a trade that's it your sideline [ __ ] there's nothing
51:32
to stop you from from being you know preventing you from being sidelined you can step into a trade whenever you want
51:38
right say I don't do anything worst case scenario price pushes back above here I can buy my ethereum I sold most
51:45
of it here I'm just buying back above here with the stop at the low I'm looking to trade this what have I missed
51:50
one to two to 3% and I've avoided all this significant D um draw down
51:57
in p&l you tell me what's better just to hold [ __ ] and just hope it goes higher
52:03
or to actually action and take profit anticipating a corrective move I don't
52:08
know where or to when and looking for a reversal to get back into the trade Trade It High same [ __ ] will happen on
52:15
the way down as well when it's time to short the market I will absolutely short the market 100% I couldn't give a flying
52:22
[ __ ] what other people say or the F that you know bears are hated at the end of
52:28
the day my p&l won't hate me for for for you know looking to make trades that are
52:33
that are going to make sense I mean too many people are looking
52:40
for the home run but if you're looking for the home run then put it into one Al right but your other alts you should be
52:46
taking profit on them at some point but have that one Al that you believe can really really can give you a home run
52:53
and if it comes all the way back to your entry price then obviously that's [ __ ] trading but you know at least you gave
52:59
yourself a chance to hit a home run but the reality is that there's no reason to be round tripping your entire stack
53:05
which unfortunately the reality is 80% of the people will do maybe 85% 90% so
53:13
that's just a harsh reality it is it is the way it is I did it in 2018 I learned
53:18
my lesson and uh I refuse to ever be in that situation ever again and um perhaps
53:24
that's why I've become very very Relentless at shorting markets or recognizing turning points in the market
53:30
because I'm always thinking about downside risk at which point is a trade going to come against me versus oh look
53:37
this could go even higher I can make x amount of money more so I'm always thinking about bottom line where could
53:43
there be an inflection point which gives me a reason to take profit not always
53:49
looking at the market thinking where is the market likely to turn so I can short it I'm thinking where is the market
53:54
likely to turn in an uptrend where I can potentially take profit okay that's the
53:59
mindset that I have uh heat map I mean it's variable
54:06
really whatever makes sense in terms of heat map variability it's at currently it was at 3.4 and the low at 1.8 it
54:15
doesn't really matter you know you just you can even just look at this you can see where
54:20
where where the books are stocked and this is just by this is just one exchange so really uh you should be you
54:27
should be looking across multiple exchanges um there's various tools that'll let you do that out
54:38
there there are various tools that let you do that out
54:43
there I believe this is one of them okoki okay you kind of get a an
54:53
overview of Mark depth across several
54:59
exchanges asks buys okay so you can see on bitcoin you've got a fairly good
55:05
level of demand at yeah 91s 91s again so
55:11
around about 91 is is where there's fairly decent um oh [ __ ] this is U I bet
55:17
this is an old image ignore that sorry um but yeah you can you can log into
55:22
that and just play around with it yourself you'll get the idea
55:37
what do we think guys any
55:44
questions are we happy with what we've covered today does it all make sense how I'm looking to trade the market what my
55:51
thoughts are what I'm looking for um
56:05
ultimately I just want to see Bitcoin volatility reduced and then we can trade altcoins again in the next week or
56:17
two I'm I free to go can I go now now that I've shared my plans and my
56:23
views of the market and how why I believe this is a much needed correction I'm a free to go I'm a free
56:30
man no longer tied to the shackles of
56:41
streaming I'll cover that next week C I'll cover that next
56:47
week Bitcoin dominance that's a good point we missed that one off didn't we
56:53
um oh look at that holy [ __ ] um straight on
57:01
the Richard what's a good uh Yori word straight on the Noggin straight on the nose but yeah
57:08
look Underside retest send it lower down now send it lower
57:19
down yep straight on the line there boom
57:27
not bad if FX was around that's what Sam you probably
57:34
would have created a a market to trade this I reckon but it is what it is all right folks that's it for me so
57:41
next week I will have more information on the group which is going to go live on January the
57:46
5th um I've got another stream later this week and then I've got one more after that and then I'm calling it a day
57:53
for December but apart from that I hope you've enjoyed today's session stay calm
57:58
stay focused look for opportunities in the market as long as Market structure
58:03
holds corrective structures are necessary to see continuation higher
58:09
other than that I wish you all a fantastic remainder of the week and hopefully I'll catch you on the next
58:15
stream stay blessed take care good
58:25
luck e
