All right, you should be live. Good evening, everybody. It's Trader XO here once again. It's the 12th of December,
0:09
2025. The time is just after 9:00 p.m. UTC. Just give me a quick confirmation that you can all hear me, okay? And you
0:16
can see my screen.
0:30
How's how's December been so far? All good. Are you guys trading or you just
0:36
winding down into the uh Christmas period?
0:44
It's been a fascinating year, hasn't it? It's been a very fascinating year.
0:50
Hey, Bal and Speeds. Hope you're well. Hey, J Bear. How's it going, man? Good to see you there. All right, first of
0:55
all, I just want to give a special thank you to Moonberg AI for partnering with
1:00
me, who are sponsoring this stream. Anything said in today's video is not financial advice. It's just my view of
1:06
the market. And what we'll do is just keep it really light on this stream, just more of a high context
1:12
view of the markets. Probably going to spend about 30 minutes on stream. It's Friday, you know, probably not going to
1:17
expect too much to happen over the weekend. Um, but really just looking ahead as to what my expectations are
1:24
over the next 2 3 weeks and areas that I'm looking to trade. Um, Bitcoin is
1:29
pretty much trading in the way that I thought it would. So, um, we'll we'll cover that in today's stream. Um, and
1:36
also at some point I I just want to quickly give a mention to for those people who are asking, I've been well, I
1:42
was initially running what was supposed to be a six week um, mentorship
1:48
last year. Well, this year from April, um that just dragged out to 6 months,
1:53
but you know, I've enjoyed it. It's actually been really fun. Um raised some good funds for charity. There have there
1:59
have been people who have been asking, hey, so will we be extending it? Will we be taking people on? I will be extend
2:04
extending it from January through to March. Okay. And that's in partnership
2:10
with the exchanges and the terminal. Uh if anybody's interested, like I said, it's not paid. Um I will be streaming
2:16
twice a week. there's a [ __ ] ton of information that you can go through. So during the mentorship, I've pretty much
2:22
covered, you know, what my process is, what my manual is, uh the psychological aspects of trading and how how I track
2:29
that through to goal setting through to risk management. Um how I use orderflow
2:35
parts one and two. I've left some further content for for members to view
2:41
and resources to look up on. Um, and essentially over the last week or two,
2:47
I've just covered in in depth trading strategy part one and trading strategy part two. Now, the reason why I've done
2:53
this is because when I first started trading, in all honesty, I think it's easy to anchor um and get caught up in
3:01
the technicals of trading. Nobody ever really shows you or tells you what a
3:07
process looks like or how to develop a strategy. Everybody talks about it. And so what I've tried to do really is just
3:13
keep a very foundational view, but something that you can build upon. Uh and the feedback that I've got from
3:20
quite a lot of uh current members is that it's been very helpful, very impactful. Uh and it's just an insight
3:26
into how how I trade markets, you know, from a price action perspective or orderflow perspective. It's not the only
3:32
strategy. You know there's various ways but it's just basically in my view as a trader uh as much as we like to think
3:39
technicals matter for me I think technicals are just 20% of the game it's really you as an individual your
3:44
riskmanagement framework your nuance the way you think about market your strategies that you trade in terms of
3:52
you know are you seeing repeatable patterns are you seeing inefficiencies in the market that you can exploit um
3:57
time and time again it's it's a form of pattern recognition sometimes there are going to be nuance es or anomalies where
4:04
there are there are there are events that happen very very quick such as the April crash such as Bitcoin dropping
4:10
from 125 to you know 103 or 104 in October those that those are events that
4:16
you just have to get into the flow and the rhythm of the market and sometimes there's no way that you can really back
4:21
test those events so that it varies okay so that's essentially what that is about
4:27
um and obviously like I said I've been doing my market review so if anybody is interested you're more than welcome
4:32
to sign up. It's on my link tree on my uh Twitter profile. If you just go to
4:37
Twitter, like I said, it's just going to be running from January to March and then I'll be calling it a day. Go to LinkedIn um or sorry, not LinkedIn, link
4:44
tree, click on the substack um training mentorship and there just a form that you have to fill out and kind of follow
4:50
the um the uh preconditions there. Okay, so now that's that out of the way, but
4:56
let's uh let's quickly move over onto Bitcoin. Um,
5:02
basically the last time I streamed was in what mid
5:08
November I think it was 2 3 weeks ago or two weeks ago with the d WMD uh forex
5:16
and I think overall when I look at Bitcoin um it's it doesn't come as a surprise you know if we just start off
5:22
from the higher time frame and go back to what I've said maybe let's bring up a different chart
5:28
with more data. Now what's been key for me and once again you know I don't know if I've
5:34
covered this in the previous stream frame but what has been key for me in in every market top okay one of the things
5:41
that we see on Twitter is is many participants becoming obsessed with
5:47
calling the top and that's not quite how I approach trading what I'm really looking for is areas of confluence
5:55
or areas where I think okay you know what there there's a likelihood we're going to get a very good reaction here
6:02
and that reaction is probably going to be to the downside. Whether that's the top or not is irrelevant. Okay, it
6:08
doesn't really matter. Who gives a flying [ __ ] Whether you call the top, but did you trade it? That's all that matters. Did you manage your risk to the
6:15
downside? Did you manage your portfolio? So that that for me is more important as
6:20
opposed to oh look, I call the top. Calling the top is a hindsight event. Okay, if you called it great, but did
6:26
you trade it? That's all that matters. Okay. But the key thing and the one thing that I that I continued uh
6:32
continuously repeated throughout September heading into October is that
6:38
every time Bitcoin and and and from experience having traded this market, every time
6:44
Bitcoin has on a monthly time frame, just simple price action, when you see
6:50
these monthly wicks at the highs and these monthly wicks at the lows, it's often served as an inflection point. You
6:56
can see that again in 2021, okay, recognizing the risk of the market
7:01
and I fully remember um having got caught out on Bitcoin on the way down in 2018, which was my first real bare
7:09
market where I experienced up to 70% account loss. Okay, despite the fact I
7:14
was still up overall, nobody wants to experience a 70% draw down in the space
7:20
of 6 to 7 to 8 9 months. But really when I look at the markets and having learned
7:25
from 2018 uh late 2017 2018 and having gone through significant amounts of back
7:31
testing and looking at various charts the one common pattern that that you will see which you have to pay attention
7:37
to in my opinion is the wicks and the monthly. Okay this for me is a sign of rejection. no acceptance further higher.
7:45
And moving forward, what do we see in um
7:50
2024, right? When Bitcoin finally broke out of this almost a year's range of price
7:58
action from June 2022 all the way through to October 23, that's just over a year's price action going sideways in
8:04
a range. All right, the market rallies. We saw many participants on the timeline
8:10
various news outlets calling that the fact that hey we think the top is in on Bitcoin here you know but at the end of
8:18
the day when why because when you look at a price action that the consensus was that look Bitcoin's making lower lows
8:24
and lower highs but what they're failing to recognize is that really when you look at price action from a weekly
8:30
perspective is that sorry just bear bear with me a second is
8:36
that effectively you are in a range. This is not a trendbound
8:41
environment. This is not contextually a trend. It could have been a form of distribution. It could also have been a
8:48
form of reaccumulation. But even with a simple band system, there was nothing in
8:54
here that was illustrating to me the fact that look, we're likely to break down and sell off significantly. And
8:59
like I said, when you think when you understand the concepts of one-time framing, and I've covered this on the
9:05
mentorship that with one-time frame framing, price really does not [ __ ] around. Okay? When you get expansion,
9:12
you do not get an overlap of candles. Okay? It is literally very good market
9:17
structure. It is momentum based trading where there's no real overlap of price. Price pauses and continues going lower
9:24
down. Even on the uh on the on the lower time frames on the 4 hour, you'll see and it's the same on the way up. Classic
9:30
signs of price trading within a range breaking above. Look at the shift in the momentum of the bands. Look at the the
9:37
trajectory of the bands. Okay? Look at the gradient of the bands as well. That tells you that this is a market that you
9:43
do not want to be fading. You want to be flowing with the momentum to the upside. And when I talk about the one-time frame
9:50
aspects of price, we'll look at the breakout of the range and look at the very minimal overlapping of price. We
9:56
never got a really deep pullback here. Continuation higher. Did we get a deep pullback of this candle? No, we didn't.
10:01
Continuation higher. A form of consolidation. But again, was there any real significant overlap of price? No,
10:08
there wasn't. It wasn't until here where you can see there's a shift in the
10:13
actual structure of price. this. Now, if you look at the trajectory of price, if
10:19
you look at the bands, you can see the momentum dissipating. And that is for me the first signs that all right, we could
10:25
be entering a period of rangebound price action. It's essentially range
10:32
imbalance up into a rotational market. Whether the market goes higher, whether
10:37
the market goes lower down at that point is anybody's guess, but you have to recognize the environment that you are
10:43
trading in. And so going back to my point of understanding and and using the wicks
10:50
and and reading this starting off from a a top- down context, what was the market
10:56
telling us in July and again in August? The fact that we traded 115 as a monthly
11:03
candle body high, did we ever at any point close above that level? We had
11:09
price trading back above it in August, rejection from there. Price retesting the level in September, rejection from
11:15
there. Price coming back up in October, taking out the previous high. The moment
11:22
we found acceptance back inside on a 1, two, three top of the range highs was
11:27
the reason for me to start looking for shorts in this. Now, it wasn't purely based upon price action. It was
11:33
primarily because number one, I'm I'm aware of the fact that all right, I know for a fact that we've had several
11:40
attempts at closing upon this and if we reject one more time, there's going to be a significant pullback. Okay, now I
11:47
wasn't talking about extended targets. So, I think Bitcoin is going to come all the way down to $80,000. For me, it was
11:54
the fact that well, on the higher time frame, understanding what I saw, okay, and I I I've even tweeted about this
12:01
prior to the market dropping. I think I tweeted around about on the 5th or the 6th of October that I'm a seller here or
12:08
yeah, I'm pretty much sure I said that and explained why I took the short because of what I saw in terms of the
12:13
momentum, in terms of the the the the positioning of price, the fact that I saw this as really not aggressive buying
12:21
in terms of new market interest or open interest, but essentially shorts getting squeezed out of their position on the
12:28
order flow and therefore recognizing that what drove price higher wasn't effectively new participants in the
12:35
market. It was essentially shorts being forced out their position followed by
12:41
those who were trying to break out the trades setting up as a perfect trap. And when you see a sign of absorption or
12:49
buyer exhaustion, they're your key inflection points and they often occur
12:54
at the extremities of price action, especially around the range highs and
12:59
the range lows. And the key thing for me is how do I identify those big swing trades?
13:04
In my opinion, when I'm looking for those big swing trades which set up every once in a while, well, guess what?
13:10
I'm looking at price action on the weekly and the daily. Where are the key swing points of price? Where can I think
13:16
about structuring the trade to get in if this is a rejection? And the whole
13:22
premise of this was basically based upon the fact that well, if you look at the monthly price action here, this looks
13:27
dog [ __ ] You've got all this market inefficiency to the upside where price has spent four months within a range and
13:35
it fails every time around that 120 level. Why is that? Okay. And and the
13:43
reason I'm covering this today again and I covered this this isn't hindsight because we we talked about this in on
13:49
the September stream. We talked about it on in the October stream prior to the market correcting that. I think there's
13:57
you've got to be cognizant about risk to the downside. Okay,
14:03
I wasn't saying that the market top was in, but you have to be cognizant about risk to the downside because ultimately
14:08
when you look at this from a price action perspective, this is your consolidation followed by a thrust candle up retest
14:15
and rally higher. So this is ultimately for me, this is the trading range that
14:20
we're in from a top down perspective. So one the the key takeaway that I that I
14:26
just want to make is that always pay attention to the monthly time frames at these key inflection points. Look at
14:31
what price is telling you when you see these deep wicks whether it's at support whether it's at resistance they have
14:37
often more times than not based upon the sample size that we have okay been key
14:43
inflection points in the market and they sometimes it sometimes takes several weeks two to three months.
14:51
So that's on the higher time frame. Now if you drop to the weekly looking at the bands here, one of the
14:58
key aspects and what's been structurally different com in comparison to anything we've seen
15:06
this market cycle is what? Well, this is the 1221 EMA. All right. Now, I don't
15:12
use the moving averages as a way to get into trades and get out trades. I use it
15:17
more from a contextual perspective, from a structural perspective. Okay, it just gives me an easy way to visually observe
15:25
what the momentum is, which direction is price, where's weakness likely to occur, and at which point will will the market
15:31
break down aggressively. Now, the key observation here is that what do you think the
15:38
difference is? And I think I may have covered this on the on the private stream, but what is the difference between price trading below the bands
15:44
here and here versus this here? Any
15:55
takers
16:07
the key for me. Okay, again when we think about one-time framing when we look at previous price
16:14
action, what did we see happen in 2021? Price broke down aggressively over two
16:20
weeks, okay, and sold off into a period of consolidation. That was a drop from 60K to 30K. Look at what price did
16:28
thereafter. Sideways rangebound price action for 2 3 months. Okay. Then again,
16:36
the key in this instance was was the fact that price was consolidating below the 1221 weekly moving average.
16:45
Later in 2021, November price breaks down. Okay, clean one-time framing,
16:50
lower lows, lower highs. On the way down, what do you observe? We get a breakdown
16:57
in price. Okay, consolidation of the bands, sells off for a second leg down,
17:03
further phase of rangebound price action. Again, what many perceived to be at that time
17:11
in 2022. Oh, look this is bullish market structure because we're getting lower low lower we are getting higher lows and
17:18
higher highs. Therefore, this is bearish. Well, not necessarily because when you look at the from when you look
17:24
at this from a rangebound perspective, the key thing that you want to observe here is the fact that well looking at
17:31
price action, wasn't this just a mean reversion back into the bands? And and the key sign of
17:38
weaknesses was a failure of the range highs. Okay. Yes, it could have squeezed higher, but that that for me wasn't the
17:45
trade. The trade or the risk was that this is structurally making lower lows
17:50
and lower lower highs on the higher time frame, but people are getting caught caught up on the daily time frame.
17:56
Talking about higher highs and higher lows, yet contextually, we're going trending down. Okay, look at the the the
18:03
velocity and the trajectory of the bands.
18:08
That's key for me. Okay. And so we we traded above the bands. The minute we closed through the 12 and the 21 on the
18:15
weekly, the rest was history. Okay. So this is your drop base drop.
18:22
Moving over to examples of market in an uptrend.
18:28
If you look at price, okay, where people again getting caught up on market structure. Oh, look, we're making lower
18:34
lows and lower highs. This is going to this is quite bearish. Not necessarily because look at the price action. We are
18:40
not one time framing. It's overlapping candles. Okay. Yes, it's making lower lows but it's we are seeing strong
18:48
buying coming in at these range lows filling in a level of efficiency into the origin of the move up. That is your
18:55
buying opportunity there. Okay. Classic two time framing. Okay. Same
19:01
again happened here. price distributes, breaks down. But did we get
19:07
from this candle breaking down here, did we get one time framing of continuation
19:12
lower down? No, we didn't. We've got overlapping of price. Now, in this instance,
19:19
okay, we can see price has done what it's been rangebound at these highs for
19:25
several months. Now if you look at the context of reading price action, price
19:30
starts trading through the bands on the weekly and it continues going down. Okay, you can see that it's got very
19:37
clean one-time framing and now we've got that pause in the market.
19:42
So all this expectation that we've seen on the timeline that oh look this is a really good buying opportunity. Bitcoin
19:47
is just going to do this all the way back up again. I'm sorry but I struggle to see that because structurally this is
19:54
different to any other period that we've had during this bull trends. Okay. And
19:59
the fact that for the first time we are seeing the bands rolling over. So what's
20:06
my expectation? Well my expectation for the next few weeks as well look if it looks like a range and it's trading like
20:11
a range then it probably is a range. And again, when we look at what price is doing here, it's it's that same classic
20:18
case of, oh, look, higher lows and higher highs. This this must be really bullish. But my concern is that all
20:24
right, you know, whether this breaks down over the coming weeks remains to be
20:29
seen. But the the key level for me is the the
20:34
one big level that I'm paying attention to is not only am I looking for a possible mean reversion back into the
20:41
bands at that 10 199 to 102 level but followed by a rejection similar to
20:49
what we had in 2022. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm looking for another big leg down. Okay? I'm simply
20:56
stating the fact that without a shift in context, okay, without a shift in
21:03
context and a shift in structure where we get a higher high followed by a higher low, flip of the bands, only then
21:09
can I think to myself, you know, we've got a real chance now of going back to the all-time highs. Until then, if this
21:15
is going to be rangebound, okay, whether you want to take the range from this level here. Okay,
21:25
that's my uh range lows and these are my highs. Taking the mid of this comes in
21:31
where? At this level here. Okay, every all I'm looking to do effectively is just trade from a high time frame
21:38
perspective, from a swing trading perspective. I'm not talking about intraday. I'm not talking about intraweek trades more from a high time
21:45
frame perspective where I'm looking for those big key inflection points in the market where I know that I can get some
21:50
really good size on I can compound in the trade and I can take it from range high back to range low. That's talking
21:56
about taking it from one or twos to potentially down to these lows here of 70 75k.
22:02
Those are the trades that I like to really go after which come every several
22:07
weeks, once a month, maybe once every two months, but when they set up, they give you some of the best asymmetric
22:14
plays, whether it's to the upside or whether it's to the downside. And so what I then do is is further
22:20
split the range into range quarters. You can see what's been capping price to the upside here. Soon as we lost this level,
22:26
straight through into the range quarter of the lower bound of the range here. Okay, so that's effectively the range of
22:32
the levels that I'm looking to trade over the next several weeks.
22:40
Now, dropping down onto the daily,
22:47
what's been key here for me is the fact that in terms of price being capped to the upside, not only do we have the
22:54
yearly open level, which is coming in around about 93 something, I think it's
23:00
uh let's have a look. Okay,
23:07
let's mark this in green. I should have really used my indicators, but it's fine. Just really want to
23:14
rattle through this. What's capping price to the upside? Not just because it's the yearly open,
23:20
okay, but it adds confluence that contextually, all right, I'm seeing some
23:25
level of structural weakness here. And then the fact that we have a series
23:31
of higher highs. Okay, at some point I
23:37
suspect that the two setups that I'm looking to trade if I wasn't in a position is that from this point onwards
23:44
if I get a move back up to to to trade 94s 94.5
23:50
into this zone here because this was the origin of the move down okay which where we saw continuation from consolidation
23:59
underside retest into trend down okay so this is the key inflection point as to what's capping price in the market. We
24:06
are into a level of supply where sellers are stepping back into the market. If there is a move back up, okay, with
24:13
rejection, that for me is a trade back down possibly targeting this level here. All right, into uh 86.3, 83.4
24:23
or 84s. Okay, wherever that is. Looking for that failure of acceptance with
24:30
rejection to get back inside. Okay. And and again what I'm looking for effectively here is what is again signs
24:37
of aggressive buying. Okay. Aggressive
24:42
buying in the sense where in the market whether it's shorts closing out whether
24:48
it's late longs piling in aggressive forced okay buying combined with late
24:56
buying into some stacked asks passive asks where for all that buying effort
25:01
for all that aggression and large volume occurring on the footprint or the delta price is unable
25:08
to push higher. That tells you that if if if these passive asks are able to absorb all that aggressive buying
25:16
and eventually we see a rotation of signs of exhaustion and then like I said when you see passive asks on the heat
25:23
maps what happens to these guys or people who never got filled. Okay, these are your large commercial players
25:30
who are looking to get their positions filled. What are they going to do? Not only are they filling their positions
25:36
from a passive perspective, but soon they'll start hitting the bids
25:41
as well, chasing the m momentum back down. And then those players who are waiting for all their asks to get
25:47
filled. Well, what often do you see on a heat map? you not see on the way up on the way down where you have a wall of
25:52
asks, okay? And then price trades into it, doesn't go all the way through it, you see signs of exhaustion because you
25:58
see heavy, heavy volume, a lot of effort. And for all that effort, there really isn't much price movement just
26:05
like we saw at 125s. And then when price starts rolling over,
26:11
well, all those late positions that opened up here along with forced forced buyers, so shorts who got squeezed out
26:17
their position, well, any participants who have been buying on the way up, they're going to start puking on the way
26:23
down. So, you're going to get that delta unwind. And then what you see from the from the from a heat map perspective or
26:29
from a DOM perspective is that you start seeing the orders shifting down. So when
26:34
price does spike up, it hits a wall of resistance and they get filled and start
26:39
hitting into the bid. And then those participants who are in from slightly lower down, say if you're long from this
26:45
level here and price is coming down, what are you going to do? You're just going to stand there and think oil be fine. I don't I don't mind being
26:51
offside. the fact that we've had one, two, three attempts of failure at the at
26:57
these local range range highs that you probably need to get out the trade at
27:02
that point. And then that's what gives you that fast aggressive move, that delta unwind to the downside. And what
27:08
is that delta unwind? Really, what you want to see in terms of the market selling off, you don't want to see
27:13
shorts piling in and open interest rising. What you really want to see and these are where you get your fast moves
27:20
is when open interest is declining, okay, and CVD is going down. That tells
27:26
you not only are sellers or shorts entering the market, but really forget this notion of long or short. Think of
27:35
it as buyers or sellers in the market. Because when you're a buyer, what do you do after you've bought? You become a
27:40
seller. And when you're a seller, when you want to close out your position, what are you effectively doing? you are buying, okay,
27:48
to settle out your position. And so if anybody for those players who are who are potentially long and we get a drive
27:55
up and price rolls over again, well, that's going to give you that cascading effect lower down. And that's why you see those sharp sell-offs that happen
28:01
just like we did here, followed by a spike in relative volume and some liquidations coming in. And and
28:07
generally when you see that spike in relative volume and liquidations, they generally serve as good inflection
28:12
points. Now what you have to do is identify all right if I see a spike in
28:18
liquidations on relative volume where is price in that moment in time and does it align with the strategy strategy that
28:25
you're looking to trade and for me when it comes to rangebound trading it's effectively it's more often than not
28:31
around the extremities whether it's a local range whether it's a high time frame range they're the levels that I'm
28:37
looking to trade so in this instance on Bitcoin I don't know from this point whether this is going to be the next leg
28:43
down into 85s. And equally, I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised that with the fact
28:49
that we might get another push up later next week. Okay, I'm not here to call
28:55
the market and say, "Look, I think we're going to go down here next or I think we're going to go up." Doesn't matter. All I give a flying [ __ ] about is all
29:00
right, if price trades are high and if I'm looking at that price action, I see signs of buyer exhaustion or a lot of
29:07
buying effort for not much rewards, that's probably something that I need to be paying attention to. Okay? And so if
29:14
I get this set up, then that's going to be the short for me. Looking for price to come out and take these lows back
29:20
into the mid of that range from about 992s
29:25
into 86. Thereafter, if we see rejection from there, then we can talk about the
29:30
the lower bound of the range. Looking to take out this high, taking sorry, looking to take out this low and then we
29:37
can talk about all right, we've got all this price action here to fill out as well. Okay, so that's the short scenario that I'm
29:45
looking to entertain. Now, again, the key point that I want to make is, oh, so
29:51
you you only marked your you only marked it up to 96. Doesn't matter. 95s, 96, 97s. I do not know where the market is
29:59
going to re reject from, okay? But I'm being reactive. I'm looking at the price action in real time. Reading the market
30:05
in real time. That's what matters. Okay? So, all this [ __ ] about, you know, oh, I'm just going to set up a position here
30:11
with my um entry there and I think I'm going to put my stop at some random
30:17
arbitrary high. I'm sorry, but for me, that's how I used to trade in 2018, 2019, 2020. And what
30:23
you'd often find is price comes up, takes you out, and then you fail to get back in the trade because the reason is
30:30
that you didn't really know why you're taking the trade other than the fact that, oh, I I think we could trade these
30:35
highs, and I'm going to look for a short, but what's your reason for execution? What do you need to see in
30:41
the market for you to execute that trade? Do you even know what you're looking for to get into that trade?
30:48
And so, that's where having a system comes into place. That's where you know your edge. Edge isn't just about one
30:54
trading strategy. Edge is the collective sum of parts of that. You know your risk management. You know what position
31:01
sizing you're looking to run. You know which zone you are looking to trade. Okay. I'm looking for a potential trade
31:08
around here. Okay? Not specifically here, but looking for a reaction here.
31:13
And here's what I'm looking for. Not some Oh, here's here's a um 4hour order block. And if price pushes into there
31:21
and rejects, I'm looking to get into the trade. No, I want to do better than that. I want to see the fact that I'm
31:26
seeing a lot of aggression being absorbed. Okay? And then when price starts rejecting from that level, that
31:32
gives me further conviction because quite easily if I'm not seeing signs of absorption and at this level, if I'm
31:38
seeing signs of heavy selling by looking at the CVD and open interest is rising, what's that telling
31:45
you? If you're seeing heavy selling, large volumes of selling whilst open
31:50
interest is rising, what does that tell you about positioning? Generally speaking,
31:57
it tells you that aggressive there's there's a level of aggression in the shorts. Shorts are being open in the
32:04
market, but for whatever reason, for all that effort of selling,
32:11
they're being absorbed. price is unable to break down and where do you think their logical stops are going to be? Oh,
32:17
at some probably at some arbitrary high whether it's here whether it's here and then what do you think happens when price pushes up cascading domino effect
32:25
they become forc sellers and then you get that aggressive move to the highs okay so that's something that you want
32:30
to be looking for as opposed to Mr. order block was going to say, "Oh, look, 4hour order block here." Um, I think I
32:36
think that's that's a good level that I'm looking to sell. Takes a short, doesn't know why he executed, doesn't
32:41
understand the positioning. Price comes and rips him out and he takes a loss.
32:47
Okay, so that's just the the the thought process when it comes to trade execution
32:54
that what is your trade execution strategy? Do you actually know what you're looking for in the market?
32:59
And it could be it's entirely up to you to build that system. Like I said, for me, I've covered in the mentorship. I
33:04
use orderflow. I've given various examples. Um, and I think one of the best ways that you will learn is by
33:10
identifying patterns that repeat over and over and over and over again in the market, okay? At key levels, at key
33:17
inflection points, and observe what happens. It's not the only way. I'm not saying
33:22
that you have to go out go out there and learn orderflow. For me, order flow isn't something that I use and try to
33:28
read order flow from A to B. I'm just looking at the order flow as a sign of confirmation that yeah, you know what? I
33:34
think I I think this is what's happening in the market and therefore this increases my odds of being right in
33:40
terms of executing the trade. Okay. None of this [ __ ] ICT breaker [ __ ] Yeah, I mean, I'm sure I'm
33:46
sure his concepts are fine. I don't think there's anything wrong with it, but I just I just don't think it's it's
33:52
it doesn't really allow you to read the market. And it's not, like I said, order flow is not the only way. There are
33:57
various other ways you can look at spikes in relative volume. If you if you're seeing a surge in volume, but
34:03
price isn't really going anywhere or, you know, that's telling you that is is
34:08
there some form of u flow that you can gauge from that as to
34:14
all right, this could be an inflection point here. Okay. So, is that clear from a from a shorting perspective that if we
34:20
see a squeeze up and rejection with reasoning, okay, I'm not going to go over the footprint of the DOM today or
34:26
we see continuation and trade into that 9910 or two level. Then I think all right that's going to be the bigger
34:33
short for me because now I'm looking to trade from the extreme that and the precondition here is that the
34:39
precondition here is that this just keeps grinding up grinding up grinding up into the origin of what was the leg
34:47
down here. Okay, you can see price what was it doing previously? We broke down
34:53
trading within this range. Okay, there's your mid-range. Um, high time frame,
34:58
mid-range, local mid-range, range low. Okay, it was this range here.
35:05
Inflection, price solves off. So, if we get a push up back inside, then I want
35:10
to see, okay, signs of what? Again, a lot of buying
35:17
effort, maybe forced buyers, shorts, puking after trying to short this move all the way up, giving up here, and
35:23
eventually passive players are there soaking up all the buys and eventually moved down. So again, how I trade is I'm
35:29
not a confirmation trader in the sense of, oh, look, I'll wait for price to take out this level here and if we get
35:34
acceptance back inside, I'm going to take the short. That was probably me from 2019, 2020.
35:41
I'm actually looking at inefficiencies in the market that all right there's some really bad positioning here and um
35:48
I think I can take advantage of this. Okay. So for me it's what's really
35:55
helped me develop my game is understanding how to read signs of absorption, how to read signs of
36:00
exhaustion and try to recognize those traps in the market. not essentially
36:05
traps in the sense of oh look you know longs are trapped or or shorts are trapped. I don't look at it like that.
36:12
I'm looking at looking at it more from I don't really care if it's longs or shorts in the market. I'm looking at
36:17
positioning you know spikes of high volume transacted at this level where
36:24
the delta is very positive. That's telling you there's a lot of buying, whether it's force buying or whether it's longs opening.
36:32
There was clearly an inflection point of high transactional volume here, but price wasn't able to push higher. Why is
36:38
that? That's the big question mark. Okay. Um, and so this is going to be a key
36:44
level for me that if we do get a squeeze up and it's not just a local run of these highs, um, if we do get a squeeze up, then I think this is going to be a
36:50
real testing level here because just like we saw back in 2022.
36:56
Okay. Um, I I think again keyword I I think and thinking doesn't really mean
37:02
much until that um inflection point
37:07
happens and until I can understand what the market is trying to do. You can see the the structure here that when the
37:13
market sold off aggressively, we went sideways from January 2022 all the way through to March 2022. That's two months
37:20
of price action. Okay? And already given where we are in the market,
37:27
I think we probably spent the best part of November the 25th. Give it another week
37:33
or two, it'll be Christmas Day. One month. So, what's to say that we we can't be here for another 2, three, four
37:38
weeks until the new year where we may get a an opening drive in the new year before we get a pullback lower down
37:44
again just like we did in 2022. the the one part where I see people getting a
37:50
getting carried away is that in 2022
37:55
um obviously we saw the continuation lower down and I think that
38:01
you know when I say tra I don't want to call them traders but analysts on the timeline doing [ __ ] like this where up
38:08
and then a big leg down. I mean how you supposed to trade that is that actionable? Not really. It's all a bit
38:14
of fun really isn't it? It's just being an armchair analyst. To me, that's not actionable. All I care about is that if
38:20
we're going back into a range, if it looks like a range and it trades like a range, then it probably is a range. And
38:26
so, you should expect bracketing mean reversion type price action. Okay?
38:32
Whether you want to use market profile, whether you want to use VWAP bands, whether you want to use volume market profile is it's entirely subjective.
38:41
It's your choice. Whatever your system is built upon. Okay. But generally this
38:46
is where I excel when it comes to me in reversion plays. All right. When you're looking for price to to trade the
38:52
extremities of one side, okay, in a bracketed environment
38:58
and you see a rejection at the value area high, then you know that there's a likelihood
39:04
of that we're going to return back to the point of control or the mid of the range. Okay? And so forth. All right?
39:11
That was a classic setup there using volume profile. I think the difference in this instance is that I don't have
39:17
enough data to to gauge what could be considered to to be a value area high.
39:23
But if you look at the current context of price, if this was the leg rotation down and from here we started seeing the
39:30
market oscillate higher, then I'm going to take the volume profile from this point up to here. And what does that
39:36
show you? It shows you where price has been capped. Every time price has come to the 94s, 93s, I've looked to sell
39:43
straight back into the point of control. I've covered this on the on the mentorship as well. Another way of doing
39:49
this is by looking at the VWAP mean reversion bands that if price
39:54
deviates or sorry, if price trades at the third standard deviation,
40:01
then I'm probably going to look to fade that because this price action here is not trending price action. It's a
40:07
bracketed rotational price action where you can where you can fade the extremes
40:14
and look to trade price back into the VWAP bands. That's just another way of looking at price action here.
40:38
So, just waiting for this to load up. This is on Exo Charts and I'll show you what I'm talking about here. It's it's it's not difficult to recognize. The
40:45
problem that many of you will have is that I can show you something like this and then come tomorrow, you'll try and
40:50
execute the trades, but you don't have enough sample size. You've not actually gone and looked at this playing out
40:57
over, let alone 10, five times in the market. where one, can you recognize
41:04
the environmental context that you're in?
41:09
Okay, because if you can't recognize the environmental context that you're in, the chances are you're going to [ __ ] up and deploy the wrong trading strategy
41:17
where again you're going to see people talking about, oh, I think Bitcoin can go to 106es next. But all it does is
41:22
that it just gives you mean reversion price action opportunity opportunity.
41:28
Okay, probably when it comes back down again, there's going to be an opportunity on the other side.
41:34
And for all the effort for whoever's been long here and here and here, well, guess what? They're probably going to put their position lower down. All that
41:41
effort wasted. Whereas, you've missed ample opportunities. There's always opportunities in the market. And so,
41:49
let me just show you an example of of what that looks like.
41:58
So notice how first of all when we when we identify a range here on Bitcoin okay
42:07
based upon the daily you can see what's been copying price okay prior to whenever this was even at this at this
42:14
period here previous week's high previous week's low okay what do we do we not only do we trade back into the
42:20
yearly open we took out the previous week's high and where is previous week's It's at that 94.1. All right, this is
42:28
your range level here. So, contextually, what I'm doing is coming to the chart.
42:33
I'm saying, all right, where's my likelihood of an inflection point in the chart? It's going to be at this region
42:39
here that until I see acceptance and an
42:44
imbalance up, my expectation is that this is just going to be continuous
42:49
rejection around these extremities of price. So knowing that the range high is
42:55
here, knowing that the previous week's high is here at 94.1. Well, what does that look like on a on a
43:00
VWAP mean reversion system? Well, look, price trades above the real bands,
43:05
trades into the third standard deviation. The minute, again, this is another systematic way of looking at it.
43:11
The minute we close or start finding acceptance back through the bands, okay,
43:16
back through the sorry, trades into the third standard, back inside the second, that for me is a rotation back down into
43:23
the VWAP, okay, with a stop at 2.5 standard
43:28
deviations. And I can repeat that over and over and over again. But the key for me is all
43:34
right, in terms of the order flow, what am I seeing? Well, let's have a look. Let's have a
43:39
look at the footprint.
43:44
What do we see in terms of price? This is a 30 minute chart. Let me just reduce
43:50
the tick size to 200. But you should you should see already.
43:55
Let's not even look at the figures here. But looking at price action,
44:01
okay, just looking at the delta, what do you see up top? What's this positive
44:07
delta? aggressive buying whether it's shorts closing out
44:14
whoever's got their stops here or whoever's got their stops here you know they've probably placed a stop at some previous weekly high okay recall what
44:22
what I said about the fact that well if you look at price action previous week's high here probably a good chance that
44:28
stops are resting above there as price has been breaking down looking for a bigger swing down what does price do
44:33
comes and trades into that level look at the delta All
44:55
right. I've lost my example. There we go. All right.
45:01
Key key point for me. Look at the delta. Now look at this candle. 1.6 minus 1.6. 6 -
45:09
6.5 - 4.9, right? You know, relatively in that 10 to 20 range. What do we get
45:14
up here? What's all this about? All this aggressive
45:20
buying and yet price, you got a 97, you got a 44
45:26
at the range highs into the third standard deviation of the bands. And then we close back inside the previous
45:33
candle's high and then we find that we're trading back below.
45:40
Okay, the second standard deviation band gives you that rotation back down from second standard deviation to first first
45:47
back closest pretty much close to the to the uh weekly V VWAP trade done. All
45:53
right, classic strategy that I trade. I could, you know, this is a strategy that
45:59
I actually traded. You could take this, but the chances are that how are you going to execute this if you haven't
46:05
seen this enough times? If you don't know what it's like balancing your
46:10
emotions during that trade execution when you have to pull the trigger because you've just come off the back of
46:15
a losing streak. So, psychologically, you're already in a fearful state
46:22
because you're scared to pull the trigger. and and and the other reason is that you don't have any confidence in
46:27
executing this because you've not seen it enough times. And so, like I said on on the podcast
46:33
and like I said in my mentorship, trading for me is a form of professional sports, okay? And I keep coming back to
46:40
the UFC example. You can't train in a UFC gym for 6 months and then go rock up in a UFC cage in a in a pro fight. You
46:47
are getting the knock knocked the [ __ ] out. And so why is trading any different if if you're not if you're not seeing
46:53
the repetitions and and seeing this play out over and over again? And if you to have 10, 15, 20 examples of this being a
47:00
strategy that you can trade and it's part of your playbook, how will you ever know the variances of it? How will you
47:05
ever know the nuances of it? And this is where your nuance comes into reading the market in real time because now you've
47:11
got the confidence, you've got the flow, you understand where your probabilities are skewed.
47:20
So, this for me is better than Mr. Order block saying, "Oh, look, I've got a 4hour order block. Supplies on here. Let
47:26
me just put a trade." But they can't tell you why or what other than the fact
47:31
that, oh, um, supplies on here, so I'm just going to short it or demand zone.
47:37
Just going to long it. But when I look at it from this perspective, yeah, all right, I already know that's an zone or
47:43
zone of interest somewhere here. But what am I looking for? I'm looking for the nuanced data information that comes
47:49
in that says, you know what, there's a good chance here that I could chalk off a a really good trade with a good
47:54
positive expectancy where I could execute on the second standard deviation stop at 2 and a half or at the third,
48:01
okay? Or some ATR based stop and I'm looking for a reversion back into the
48:07
VWAP. Maybe I can take half off at the first standard deviation, okay? Chasing it on the way down. Maybe I want to be
48:12
aggressive. Maybe I think, you know what, I've got my execution. I'm going to keep adding to this short on the way down
48:18
and if this starts breaking down I'm going to keep adding more. So really compounding into a winning trade. That's
48:24
how you can size up. And as you're sizing up, you're dynamically
48:30
trailing your stops without getting too tight. Give give the trade some room to breathe. But that's probably slightly
48:36
more advanced because I think quite a lot of you are likely to execute a stop
48:41
over here and I'm just going to wait until it hits target, which is fine. You know, I get it. Um, there are times when
48:46
I do that. There are times when I when I really look to be aggressive. And when I look to be aggressive is actually when
48:52
what is when price is coming into these high time frame
48:58
ranges. Okay, not into these lower time frame ranges, but more based upon the
49:04
high time frame aspect of price. And like I said, when I map that out again, what does that mean? It essentially
49:09
means that all right if I see this is my range low this is my range high and this
49:14
is my mid-range that for me is that if I
49:20
see those similar patterns occur on the footprint on the dom
49:25
or the ladder okay and I've got good context from the market profile
49:31
in the sense where
49:36
oh it's over here in the sense Well, when I look at the market profile, well,
49:42
already I know that there's there's a there's two points of interest here. We've got the naked point of control, the 95s, but not only that, if you look
49:49
over to the left, we've got one two sets of poor low uh poor highs. And so, the
49:55
the area that I'm interested in as a seller is this inefficiency here. Because look at that
50:01
thin area of price into this high volume. Well, not it's not a high volume node, but from a TPO perspective, that's
50:09
the volume point of control. Okay, I think I've got it set to volume,
50:15
not time. It might be time, but that's the time point of control. So, for me, this is an area of interest. And and
50:21
even then, if we push up higher into that key range, um mid-range,
50:27
well, guess what? Now, we've got two thin areas of single prints.
50:33
Single print there. Okay, this is going to be an area of resistance. Let me see
50:38
what the reaction is there. If I'm seeing aggressive sellers step into the market and I'm seeing on on the uh on on
50:46
the footprints and on the heat maps that or on the ladder that all this aggressive selling is being absorbed,
50:52
okay, and they're pushing and pushing and pushing, price is probably going to go higher again and and take these highs
50:58
out into this thin efficiency and then trade this one or two level. that for me
51:04
now. So do you see I'm I'm building a story that all right if price is going to keep pushing higher and I see a lot
51:10
of sellers stepping into the market but we can't seem to break down then clearly
51:15
I think there's a key word I think there's a chance that the market is likely to go higher and as this goes
51:22
higher then all this short positioning they become forced buyers and when those forced buyers and those liquidation
51:28
short liquidations come in and they're being heavily absorbed by passive sellers now I think yeah you up. I saw a
51:35
spike on the relative volume. I'm seeing absorption at the highs. This is a higher probability trade. Now, I can
51:40
look to trade it for a big swing down from one or twos into 97s. Now, I'm not saying this scenario is going to happen,
51:46
but what I'm trying to explain is is the thought process, the mindset behind the
51:51
reasoning for my execution. Now, whether I throw a set of moving averages on this is just added confluence. I know some
51:57
really good traders that trade a moving average system, and that's great because they've systemized it. Okay. As opposed
52:04
to a random H4 order block or a random daily order block. Sometimes it holds,
52:10
sometimes it doesn't. Oh, look, there's a liquidity grab above that high. Oh, look, price price came up and took the
52:17
liquidity. All right, if if it came and took the liquidity and goes higher, well then what the [ __ ] happened to that liquidity grab?
52:24
Doesn't make any sense to me, but there you go. So the point I'm trying to make is that is understanding the reason for
52:30
your execution. Not just because all prices into a supply zone. Yeah, well done. A 16-year-old can identify a
52:36
supplies on a chart after 6 months of TA and they can identify a demand zone. But
52:42
what they won't tell you is that well what are they actually looking for in terms of the micro structure, in terms of the flow, in terms of positioning.
52:50
That's what gives you that slight edge. And that slight edge
52:57
isn't me sharing what I'm enough people know this, but it it's your edge comes from
53:03
you yourself developing and training and and seeing this pattern play out again
53:08
and again and again and recognizing, all right, you know, I took a long I I saw I
53:15
saw um this play out in the past 10 times and I don't know why it didn't work out this time. I mean, I was seeing
53:20
the same patterns. Well, guess what? That's further data that you see now in an instance of where this has failed and
53:26
and what were the subtleties now of why it failed. And then you're going to see that again and then again and then
53:32
again. And then you'll start filtering out your trades. All right, you know what? The old me would have taken a long
53:37
here, but now with the data that I've got and with the back testing that I've got of of and when I say back testing,
53:44
I'm not talking about go back and look at 50 examples on the chart. When I say back tested, I'm talking about reviewing
53:49
your actual trades that you've journaled. You've traded, okay? And you've logged it in your
53:54
journal and you've taken all the screenshots. Well, that data is essential for you to progress forward. And I've said it time
54:02
and time again, just like a UFC fighter goes into a pro fight. Okay. Do you think he's really going to step into the
54:08
next fight without reviewing the tape as to how his performance was? And so for me, that's how I see trading that all
54:14
right, I've taken a trade, I've taken a win, or whether I've taken a loss. What could I have done better? Was I just
54:20
being a real [ __ ] or a real [ __ ] and not following my system? Like, which is something that I didn't do in the last
54:26
week of November because I was pissing against the wind by counter trading the trend. Why was I doing that? Because,
54:32
forget my process. I thought, oh, you know what? This looks fairly oversold. Let me try let me try and get a long here back into a short. And then I and
54:39
and then when I when I step away, I realize, you know, that was awful trading. It had nothing to do with my
54:45
system or my process. I never even reset. It's a sign of overtrading. So we we are all subject to
54:53
it because we are discretionary traders. And so you got to recognize when that
54:59
creeps into your overall scope as a trader and when when you're out of scope, okay? When you're off your
55:06
process. So that's why for me going back and journaling is very very key. Okay.
55:13
And looking at the data looking at the the the the previous performance and and
55:18
back test it.
55:23
Now final thing that I want to say is so let me just add another final piece of
55:29
confluence or context in terms of my thought process. Now,
55:35
I don't know whether the market is going to trade lower down, but this is an area
55:41
where I'm where I'd be looking to looking for some longs into a possible mean reversion into the bands or at
55:46
least into 99s, one or twos again. Whether we find acceptance, okay, and uh
55:52
we get a pullback and then shift structure, great. We can trade it to the range highs. Maybe we get a three drives. One, two, three. I'm absolutely
55:59
open to higher prices in 2026. Equally, if I see price
56:08
trade, okay, up into these bands without a pullback.
56:14
So, we don't even get the pullback over the next week or two, but we just keep drifting higher and higher and higher,
56:19
then I think it's likely that we probably see price eventually rotate lower down into a a rangebound
56:26
environment from A to B until proven otherwise. Okay.
56:33
Now, what's key for me, I'm going to end on one final note.
56:51
And I think I've covered this on previous streams. So, let's just go back to the higher time frame. Now, um, the one thing that I want to talk about is
56:57
the 50 and the 200 and 300 moving average. Did I cover this on the
57:03
previous stream? I can't quite recall whether if if I did or not, but
57:16
okay. So, purple is going to be the 300. Just ignore this label here. The 200 weekly moving average is going to be
57:21
green and the the red is the 50.
57:28
And let me ignore the Ballinger bands.
57:33
And let me ignore the the 14 and the 21. This is really interesting for me now because I did I did cover it. All right.
57:40
Well, I'll cover it again. Doesn't matter, does it? This is really interesting for me now because
57:46
when you look at historical data on Bitcoin every almost every time, okay,
57:51
now bear in mind this is the sample size that we've got and obviously it's a high time frame chart. It's a weekly chart.
57:58
What do you expect me to do? Pull 100 samples out from a weekly chart. I I can only work with what I've seen happen in
58:04
the past. And sometimes it isn't just about the indicator. It's more about the structure. But what the moving averages
58:11
do is give me confluence that I'm not saying that I think we're going to drop to the 200 or the 300 moving average.
58:20
I'm basically saying in a nutshell that look in previous market cycles and of course
58:26
this cycle could be different. Okay, I'm I'm being objective. I'm not marrying a bias. I'm not forcing my opinion onto
58:34
myself. I'm just saying, look, here's an area where I think there could be a level of risk in the chart. I'm sorry,
58:40
but my my stop my my watch stopped working what, half an hour ago. So, I I
58:45
I think we're about 10 minutes into the stream anyway. So, look, simply put, 50 moving average
58:53
weekly, we break below it. Look at the the speed of the move down. We get an aggressive selloff. Oh, look, higher
59:01
highs and higher lows. This must be bullish. We're probably going to go all the way back up again. Nope. We get a
59:06
second leg down into the 200Ely moving average. Exhibit A. Exhibit B. Price
59:13
breaks down from the highs, trades through after testing the 50weekly moving average as support underside
59:19
rejection, consolidation, expansion, drop, compression. Okay, if you think
59:27
about the clearance thrust pattern, that is it there. Compression into continuation.
59:32
All right, that's exhibit B. What about exhibit C? Exhibit C. Well, look at
59:38
price action here. Trades into the 50, find support. Look what happens
59:43
thereafter. Beautiful one-time framing. And this was the COVID crash.
59:49
The market will always go where it wants to go. Okay, the news just helps it get there. It helps for it to get there
59:54
faster. And then what happens? Okay, when when the markets are breaking down,
59:59
fueled by news, what happens to the dynamics of the order book? Market makers pull away, orders get pulled.
1:00:06
Okay, are you really going to stand in front of a a falling knife or are you going to pull your orders because you think, you know, [ __ ] this, I'm not
1:00:12
touching this? And then that's why you get those fast
1:00:17
inefficient moves in the market followed by those large liquidations. when you understand the dynamics of what's
1:00:24
actually happening in the market and why price is able to glide very quickly from 10K to 3K and just like we saw in
1:00:30
October the 10th where we see price go from 126 down to 103 in the space of 5
1:00:36
hours 6 7 8 hours until
1:00:42
it hit or traded into a high enough level of demand. Okay.
1:00:50
And that's just the danger of markets when they break down when it's news-based or event driven and liquidity
1:00:57
gets pulled from the order books. It's it's going to move very very quickly. That's always the risk to the downside
1:01:02
in the markets. And that's where you often see those large liquidations coming in, especially in the crypto space. Exhibit C or exhibit D, I can't
1:01:10
remember what we're on, but breaks down again. Higher highs and higher lows on the daily, but not on the weekly. It's
1:01:16
just a mean reversion into the bands. Aggressive sell off where? Into the 200.
1:01:21
Into the 200 into the 200. Okay. And in this instance in the 300. Once again,
1:01:28
for the first time during the entirety of this bull market, we are now trading
1:01:33
with acceptance and one time framing up until 82k of price. Now we're seeing
1:01:42
overlapping of price. This is why it's for me a rangebound environment. I think
1:01:48
it will continue to be a rangebound environment for the best part of the next few weeks. Okay, with key
1:01:53
resistance at that 99 which was our mid level because again now if I bring it
1:01:59
down off the log chart, that's our key mid level. That's the range high and
1:02:04
this here was our range lows. Okay, that for me is a very very interesting
1:02:12
point of inflection in the market that if I see a reason to sell this, then I'm
1:02:18
probably going to sell it with a bit of size and really then look to compound this for if we just get a drift up and
1:02:27
exhaustion for a move down. Okay, take out this low into this demand zone and
1:02:34
then we'll see what happens thereafter. All right. So, I'm just going to leave it at that for this session. Is that
1:02:41
clear?
1:02:48
Now from this you should be able to derive okay very quickly now just looking at price action on the daily
1:03:01
the range that I'm the the current range that that I'm really thinking about right now is is this here this high
1:03:10
because this was the the sell-off that we saw when when um Trump tariffs came into play and then he tweeted on Sunday
1:03:17
price reject rejected heavily from this level here, right into another low, ran
1:03:22
a retest almost a three drives into what was a level of of demand. Okay,
1:03:32
so again, we're in that level. We're at that level again. I I don't really like this type
1:03:40
of structure. Could happen. All right. would like for
1:03:45
price to push up into 102s or 97s. 97s or 102s is are two levels that I'm quite
1:03:52
keen to sell. And then as a buyer, if this is going to be a rotational price
1:03:57
action, then we'll figure it out if and when we trade
1:04:04
somewhere here. Okay, we'll refine what we're looking for depending on what this
1:04:09
structure looks like, how this resolves, whether this resolves to the upside, whether it breaks down from here, we'll have to wait and see.
1:04:20
Final note, I just want to make um special thank you to my partners,
1:04:26
Moonberg. It's something that I've been observing when I talk about filters and
1:04:31
scanners. What's interesting about Moonberg and especially for those of you who like to play around with
1:04:38
low caps in the trenches um for me this is really interesting as a as a project and as a it's more of a
1:04:46
scanner for me. And so one of the things that I've been watching for the last seven, eight, nine, 10 days is that if
1:04:52
you just come over to uh Moonberg AI, if you go to the Moon Scope, which is a scanner, and I keep talking about the
1:04:58
importance of scanners, like when it comes to trading, right? When it comes to trading,
1:05:05
honestly, pay attention to this. When it comes to trading the markets, do you or do you not find yourself scanning
1:05:11
through loads of different charts and you feel very disorganized when it comes to finding the next trade, finding the
1:05:18
next opportunity? You're seeing all these charts setups being shared on Twitter or look long here, short there.
1:05:25
You don't know what you're looking for. If you're trading other markets or anything other than Bitcoin, then the
1:05:31
key is that you want to be finding, especially in this environment, momentum based scanners. All right?
1:05:39
And so what does that mean? When you have a good strategy and a good system and a good filter, then those trades are
1:05:46
going to find you. And so one of the good good things about
1:05:52
Moonscape is that these all are low cap [ __ ] right? And I'm I'm not going
1:05:58
to shill any low cap [ __ ] But all I'm saying that what I'm looking to do next week is have some fun. I'm going to
1:06:05
spin up a wallet, maybe drop, I don't know, 10 soul in there and see how far I can run it up. But what's really interesting is that when there's an
1:06:12
opportunity on this scanner, you just leave it open running in the background. And what you'll hear is when something
1:06:19
comes up, you'll hear the scanner beep. And if you look at some of the players that this has been calling, I mean, and
1:06:25
and these are some serious low caps, right? Uh some do going up up into like 3 4 5 mil. You get some really big
1:06:31
winners. But what this does is that if you if you look at this, this was called 19 hours 19 hours ago and it rallied
1:06:37
400%. I think there was some more. I think there was another one a few days ago that went 4,000%. So, all I'm
1:06:44
looking to do is just basically [ __ ] around in the trenches whilst the market is dead. And every time I hear
1:06:51
the beep goes off, I I I just shove like half a soul into a play. If it goes up and it pulls a 4, 5x, then great. I'm
1:06:57
just going to see if it can spin up a um 10 solar account. I I think this is great for anybody who's got a small
1:07:02
account and they just want to DJ, not necessarily DJ from a leverage perspective, but you know, you're
1:07:08
looking for those um looking to run up a small balance, a few soul and see how
1:07:13
far you can take it. Kind of do a one Salana to a 10 Salana challenge. But but
1:07:18
the key thing, yeah, I am a bit of a trencher. I I've lost so much money in the trenches. You don't want to know how
1:07:24
much I've lost over the last year. Well, it's not been that bad, actually. I only risked like two and a half% of my entire
1:07:31
net worth and literally every meme coin that I bought went to [ __ ] anyway. So it some of them went up quite significantly
1:07:37
and then they just went flat on their ass. So I remember the whole um do you remember the um gold scene forest? Does
1:07:45
anybody remember those coins from what late 202 was? No, it was 2024 wasn't it?
1:07:52
the um yeah, Goatsy, Forest, um obviously
1:07:58
Faulcoin came from that whole whole um play.
1:08:04
That was fun. That was good fun. Yeah, but I've just I've just held I've
1:08:10
I've honestly held it. I I got in at 2 million market cap and it's probably the only meme coin that's that's still up
1:08:16
for me. So, if if it takes off, it takes off, it doesn't, then all right, it is what it is. It's not too fast, but I'm
1:08:22
sure it'll do okay in a bull market. But just something to watch out. And the other thing that I probably want to add is that from what I've observed when I
1:08:30
look at the scanner here, um generally the best time has been the New
1:08:36
York session. So, if you remember a few weeks ago, I had um cyber cyber came on and we were
1:08:44
talking about the uh people app and how that had a scanner and how you can find
1:08:49
whale alerts and whale buys and when you see that happening at two, three, four times popping up on the scanner. The the
1:08:55
pro the downside of that was the fact that you have to you have to keep scanning the the telegram logs. The good
1:09:02
thing here is that you visually see it on Moon Moonberg. And if you got your Salana wallet collected, you just go,
1:09:08
"All right, you know what? Ping, I'm going to open that up. Let me see what's happening in terms of the analytics. All right, what's the average transaction
1:09:14
size?" It brings up the chart. It brings up the order book. And you think, "All right, you know what? I'm going to swap
1:09:19
half a soul, one soul, and just buy it. Hopefully, it continues moving." So the key for me is like as soon as this comes
1:09:26
up on the scanner, I just want to see a surge in buying volume and and buying activity and then think, all right, you
1:09:31
know what, if the moving averages are good and the oscillators are good and I'm seeing a lot of green on the screen,
1:09:38
then it's probably going to give you a good at least I'd say from what I've seen on average, if it doesn't do a 2,
1:09:44
three, four, 5x multiple, it does give you sometimes a nice 30 40% move if you get it early. Um, and sometimes when you
1:09:52
see volume picking up on some of these, um, that's when you can really really
1:09:57
see uh some good opportunities. But
1:10:03
but yeah, this is pretty good actually. I'm looking forward to this. Generally looking forward to playing around with uh with Moon Scope more often over the
1:10:11
next few weeks whilst the market's dead. But yeah, have fun with that. And like I said, if you if if you want to join the
1:10:18
um the 3month mentorship thing that I'm doing, then um yeah, you're more than
1:10:23
welcome to. If you don't want to, you don't have to. But it it is literally a it's not a paid service. It's not a paid
1:10:28
signal. It's literally I'm giving you pretty much the foundations as to what I wish I had when I started. Um and I
1:10:36
think I've had a lot of positive feedback from pretty much a lot of the members that I chat to in the DM. So, it
1:10:41
it it's been quite um rewarding in that perspective and like I said, the money went to well, it will be going to a good
1:10:48
charity cause anyway. So, that's that. Thank you everybody for tuning in. I hope that um I hope you've had a good
1:10:55
session or at least learned something if anything. And just kind of how I how I
1:11:01
look at markets and how I think about trading, how I think about trade execution, why I look at orderflow when it comes to
1:11:07
trading Bitcoin. I don't always look at order flow for every asset that I trade, but there are some assets where when you
1:11:14
can back test it enough times that you see various patterns or variations of a pattern playing out over and over again.
1:11:21
Uh and and it generally gives you a slight probabilistic edge that you can develop into an even better edge with
1:11:28
some with some patience. All right, God bless. I'll probably be on stream at some point next week and uh we'll take
1:11:36
it from there. Have a great weekend. Thank you very much. Cheers.
1:11:45
Yes, the current members. Carry on. All right. Take care. Bye-bye.
1:12:10
Ah, greetings, Intruder. Your presence here brings a strange anomaly. Your
1:12:15
programming seems flawed, a massive glitch. Not merely a technical slipup,
1:12:21
but a fundamental error coded into your very essence. Worse than a 404, and more
1:12:26
cringeworthy than when you accidentally doubletapped your ex's photo. And what is this glitch, you ask? FOMO. It's when
1:12:33
your logical processes shut down and emotion takes over.
