1:14
like to state that anything in today's video is not Financial advice it is just my view of the market and that's all it
1:21
is okay without further Ado we'll just talk about
1:26
the private group that I was scheduled to run um I can
1:32
appreciate there's been some issues with the uh registration link so I've had to defer the group until the
1:41
new year I I probably will be looking to start more than likely now on the 5th of
1:46
January just whilst we resolve some technical issues so just to recap what
1:51
this is about I will be opening up a free private group okay it's not paid
1:57
I'm not asking you for your money I've never run any paid service or paid groups in the past uh it's not a signal
2:03
service it's not Financial advice it's not a Discord group or a telegram group
2:09
okay and it's basically where all I'm asking for people is to sign up with my
2:14
exchange partners and upon doing so any money received via commissions I will be
2:20
donating to charity okay I do not want anybody's money I do not need referral income for me this is just a way to give
2:27
back to you guys and at the same time give back to charity in the process okay
2:33
I will be doing some funded account giveaway and prizes the next part is like I said it
2:41
will be two to three private streams videos per week okay I be I will be
2:46
posting Less on Twitter and I shall be more focused on the group the content
2:52
that I deliver it will be some real uh Core Concepts around price action
2:58
orderflow Concepts TR trade execution on the lower time frames which is a very uh
3:04
commonly asked question and also trading systemization what does that mean what does that look like I will be happy to
3:10
share some of my trade journals my trading plans my trading methodologies the processes that I go through from
3:16
journaling to using uh software to record my trades and also how I manage
3:23
the the mental aspects of trading which I think is a topic that isn't very
3:28
well covered in the crypto space um I know everybody's Keen to talk about the
3:34
mindset and the trading mindset but how do you actually Journal your mindset how do you improve from some of the emotions
3:41
that you have to battle with on a daily basis which is fear or greed or anger or
3:47
you know not having the ability to to to focus on your trading so that's going to
3:53
be the plan okay unfortunately like I said I was hoping to launch on the 2nd of December that's now being pushed back
3:58
to the 5th of January uh as an interim workaround please stay
4:03
tuned into the streams during mid December because what I will
4:09
be doing and this is the plan that I had with the group was to share my 2025
4:15
trading manual I'll be sharing some of the processes that I go go through just to Hope just to hope that it inspires
4:23
others out there who who who perhaps want to come up with their own system but they're not sure what that looks
4:28
like okay now for today's stream I was hoping to cover patterns of um distribution
4:37
exiting markets looking for top signals and how to switch how do I switch context you know from a a long
4:44
perspective to shorts however I'm going to postpone this to Sunday stream which is Sunday the 1st of December I also
4:50
think that fits very well with the monthly open so we'll talk about the monthly open strategy um and I think now
4:58
given where Bitcoin is I think you know it's no surprise to me that we are seeing a corrective move on bitcoin it's
5:04
something that I covered on the last stream and I'll talk about that in further detail today so today's video or
5:10
today's stream is essentially likely to be a continuation of what we saw from last week now as always uh the first
5:18
question I'm going to ask the chat room is last week I asked you guys what's the
5:26
high of Bitcoin likely to be okay now my question to you guys is what's
5:32
the high of Bitcoin likely to be this week now that we're getting a pullback is the top in that's the first question
5:39
do people feel or believe that the top is in or do you still believe that we are likely to go higher in December or
5:45
January please leave a comment in the chat I'm very keen to see what some of the answers or the responses
5:57
are yeah Fabio for for people who are based around the world the the streams
6:02
are basically I'm going to be launching a website okay where you have to essentially sign up with an exchange
6:08
parter and once you have your exchange ID you will then need that to register on the website all the videos will be
6:13
there okay they'll be there for as long as the website remains running that's it there's nothing to sell there's no paid
6:19
courses or anything so it it's not going to cost you anything other than you signing up VI the referral link
6:30
higher okay so everybody's so bullish right so when Bitcoin pulls back this is all just expected right you all have
6:37
this down last week as per my stream that you've got to be looking for Corrections is that
6:43
correct everybody's going to start buying the dip and send Bitcoin back to 120k
6:54
right all right okay cool all right let's kick on let's kick on um do believe it's going to be an ALT
7:03
season or or do you feel as alts are not going to run at
7:18
all 85k then higher all right okay looks let's let's crack on then I think in today's stream I just it's been a long
7:25
week for me um my brain is pretty much ride at this stage but uh we crack on look at the end
7:32
of the day the key aspects that I talked about last week
7:37
was when I mapped this range out okay ignore anything below here this is
7:43
irrelevant I I'm not marking these out to say l Bitcoin could come here or here this is just contextual overview I use
7:51
this as a range projection this is now the mid level of what could potentially be the projected highs now what I want
7:59
you to understand very very importantly that this is not me telling you that Bitcoin is likely to go to 120k on top
8:05
out what I said to you last week was that the way I use this or use ranges is
8:13
first and foremost to manage risk secondly look for points of inflection
8:19
that I can position into whether that's on the long side whether that's on the short side or whether I wish to hedge
8:26
any given position and the third aspect is it gives me something to work with with my system system you know talking
8:33
about trade systematization this is a key purpose of me I'm not in the industry like I said
8:39
to to to guess where price is going I need to see reactions and then I will
8:44
react from those levels accordingly if I see enough evidence in the price in the
8:51
charts on the data to Warrant me making a trade whether that's a long short or a
8:56
hedge okay now let's just zoom into the chart the first thing that I talked about last week and again I'm not saying
9:04
hey I called it I said this was a top that's [ __ ] okay all I said was that there's a fairly decent chance this
9:11
might be a probable top a local top I should say and therefore if you're look
9:16
into longest long in this Zone I think it's very dangerous the the risk of
9:21
reward is fairly poor because we've already had an extensive move we had an
9:26
extensive move which was very similar to this from from 44,000 up until 70,000
9:33
and again there's been very few pullbacks it's been an aggressive Trend to the upside so at some point you have
9:39
to expect a corrective move down okay and and like I I talked about last week
9:45
that it's not unusual to see Bitcoin print these 20 30%
9:51
pullbacks over a matter of weeks but yet the crowd or the sentiment out there
9:56
will start telling you that Bitcoin is likely to go to 40,000 30,000 50,000 in the next sever in the next several
10:03
weeks distribution patterns take time to play out look back at what happened in
10:09
February to March okay whether this was distribution or not at the time you don't know until it breaks down the same
10:15
happened again in October November it Bitcoin traded 1 2 3 4 five nearly six
10:22
weeks at these highs before it lost momentum and started trading lower down
10:27
so I don't believe for any point in time that this is it that this is the top
10:33
what I do believe is that price in terms of probability is likely to trade
10:39
between this 80 81 82 83 region and that 100K level there perhaps over the next
10:46
few weeks we see a rotational range One Price action
10:51
whether it's a a series of intra lower lows uh lower highs lower lows until it
10:57
finds a base before we see the push back to to take out the highs in 200k okay
11:02
that's kind of the expectation that I'm leaning towards if I'm wrong on that expectation
11:08
then where am I wrong on that expectation it's essentially where if
11:14
price starts trading below this 82 81k level finds rejection on the inside and
11:21
continues lower then there is a a a significant shift in
11:27
context for as long as price keeps rejecting from theide of the 83k level
11:33
then I have to be open to the possibility that we could trade lower down into 78 75s okay but for now the
11:39
immediate zones that I'm looking at is between 99 and 83 from a high time frame
11:45
contextual point of view is that clear
12:00
now what I also like about this chart is the fact that today is the 25th of
12:06
November and if you look at the monthly open look at this for a monthly candle I do believe that we are pricing in or we
12:14
have already pricing the high of the month we've had the low of the month at 66,000 in a matter of weeks we've
12:22
rallied to 00,000 so I do believe that this is printing now the the high of the month maybe we
12:29
get 200 again I'm not sure I'm not convinced we will uh I don't I certainly don't think we're going to break out
12:34
into new all-time highs on a sustained rally over the next several days heading into month end okay it's Monday today so
12:42
we've got four days left of the uh of the business week and then we've got the weekend and we have the new monthly open
12:48
on Sunday the 1st of December so again rule of Thum now if you understand how I
12:53
play monthly opens can anybody as hasard a guess as to what I'm going to say next
12:59
about the monthly open for December and the type of strategy that I that I will be looking for on bitcoin I'll I'll I'll
13:06
leave that to the chat to to reply with and um and then I'll explain essentially what I'm looking for I just don't know
13:18
where thank you I appreciate you all I I really appreciate the the warm comments in the chat you know
13:26
um it's it's uh yeah thank
13:32
you I will talk about where I'm looking to close the BT uh Bitcoin short that I've got I just want to make it clear um I'm
13:40
not here to blow my own trumpet I am short on bitcoin but that short is not an outright short it's more of a hedge
13:46
against my spot position that's all it is it's downside protection it's downside insurance I still obtain and
13:53
hold my Bitcoin I'm still fully exposed to altcoins I use the Bitcoin hedge as
13:58
primary a way to offset risk and lock in the gains so it's not an outright short
14:03
and I talked about this in detail last we that if you are looking to short Bitcoin there's a very high probable
14:10
chance that you will be offside very quickly however I did raise my um
14:15
thoughts that this could be a local top and it wouldn't surprise me we went over
14:21
in detail don't be surprised if you see a 20 30% correction to the downside and
14:27
if Bitcoin ranges which I'll touch upon later in the Stream that we should see that continuation of the so-called alt
14:35
season okay so basically yeah I'm looking for we'll talk about it on Sunday stream is the the December
14:41
monthly open I'm looking for early lows of the month okay I think it's going to be fairly shallow because if we are in a
14:48
trendin market then what you generally find is that in a bullish Trend when you
14:55
have the monthly open price if it into a level of support then price trades below
15:02
the monthly open for a very very short shallow period of time the minute it
15:07
reclaims I think that then sets your inv validation at the low so let's just assume this is the monthly open and
15:13
let's just assume price opens trades above it spends a few days below again very shallow price action not pushing
15:20
away extensively and just assume that support is round about here what you
15:26
want to be looking for is acceptance back above stop at the low there's your long Trigger look for the trend
15:31
continuation momentum higher on altcoins that look relatively strong and perhaps
15:37
Bitcoin as well okay so that's in essence it's not rocket science the Simplicity of one how I trade monthly
15:44
opens it's not in isolation it's along with a demand zone or if I'm looking for the short side a supply Zone but the
15:52
overall context of price matters okay now let's just drop down into the lower time frames uh I think for me
15:59
look the fact is now that we've we're trading we've traded through this 95k
16:05
level which price was holding up as support you can see price holding up as support on on the 21st it reacted from
16:12
this level traded back up to 98 we've traded below it rejected on the inside and now we're sliding lower down okay so
16:19
I think there a fairly decent probable chance okay that if I am looking to
16:25
looking to close my short okay let's just talk about two levels that I I'm looking for price to trade into the
16:31
first real objective that I would love to see price trading into trade into is this level here it's that 85k level 86
16:41
85 call it whichever you like okay whether you want to take the candle bodies or whether you want to take the
16:46
wick it's this Zone that I'm looking for price to trade essentially to give me a
16:53
a reaction from this level for price to range and perhaps continue continue higher
16:59
the second level such that if this actually fails to hold okay let's just
17:04
say price pushes up and then we get a a significant move down into that 86k
17:11
level I wouldn't be afraid of that you know I I really would consider that as a
17:17
fantastic buying opportunity potentially on altcoins if altcoins pull back with a
17:24
a fairly reasonable drop on bitcoin and you have to expect this because look at where we where we have rallied from
17:31
we've rallied from the region of 68 69 all the way through to 99 that's a
17:36
$33,000 rally in a matter of week so you know even if you take the low to the
17:44
high you've got that 0.5 FIB level at 83,000 and that leads me on to the next
17:50
point of interest that I'm looking at here is that when you drop down onto the 1 hour time
17:55
frame oh sorry I should say 4H hour time frame there isn't another Zone
18:01
here just there that I'd be interested in okay because this was a consolidation
18:06
or the compression before we saw the expansion okay again when I when I talk about compression and expansion look at
18:12
the origin of the move the origin of the move was okay we we broke above
18:19
compression compression compression and then we get expansion pull back another
18:24
origin okay where prize found support before we saw continuation
18:29
higher so that's why these two levels are important for me or perhaps I should
18:35
say why if price is to trade into these two levels they're the two levels that I
18:40
would be looking for strength in the market looking for Price uh Bitcoin to
18:45
to show some stability and with that stability you will see an increased appetite on altcoins for as long as e
18:52
BTC moves on okay is that clear so the two levels that I've identified in terms
18:58
of where I would like to see Bitcoin show a reaction from is the 85 86k level
19:05
or alternatively the 82 81k level it's one of these two levels that I'd want a
19:11
reaction what I'm personally leaning towards and again I couldn't tell you what happens
19:18
next what I'm personally leaning towards is is more of a a 20 25% correction so if we take the
19:27
highs from here
19:32
that's 20% gets us to around about 880,000 okay when you look at
19:38
that and and again when you look at something like this let's just say 17% okay it
19:45
shouldn't come as a surprise because if you look at how Bitcoin
19:50
trades historically over the last four years you often get these fast moves
19:56
down and this is what I want to see if Bitcoin is going to pull back I want it to be fast and aggressive with a spring
20:02
and it may come back down to test the lows again but you will find a level of support where buyers are stepping into
20:09
the market and price is very shortlived in this demand Zone okay so you get one
20:14
test bounce lower high second test lower low rounded retest and then you get continuation higher alternatively you
20:22
could see something like this compression compression compression expansion pulls back into the origin of
20:28
the mo move at the lows okay that's where you want to see one 2 3 days of
20:34
trading shortlived before we see price spring even higher again so it's it's I feel as it's going to be one of these
20:41
two environments that we may okay I'm not saying we will that we may or or
20:46
what I would be looking for to to Really uh be aggressive in taking on Longs again is this type of these two types of
20:53
structures all right and again if you look back at um
21:02
the third scenario is this whereby Bitcoin actually doesn't do
21:08
anything it's followed a similar trajectory you've got this compression
21:14
of price okay into a trend line and then finally you get the expansion you get a
21:20
top for 3 4 days and then you get a pull back but it's kind of in no man's land
21:26
and then it ranges for the best part of December through to February for two
21:32
months you've got a run of the highs you've got a run of the lows price comes back into balance what does balance mean
21:38
where you have an equilibrium of demand in in a Range okay and sellers stepping
21:44
into the market at the local Highs but pric is essentially oscillating between these two zones with the extremes which
21:52
mean revert back inside and I think this is not a bad scenario either if we do
21:57
get something like this for for 6 seven weeks I think that really really gives
22:02
altcoins the ultimate environment along with e BTC to excel significantly to the
22:09
upside okay but then my question would be well if Bitcoin is truly in a trending environment does it really need
22:15
to range Bound for two months I'm not so sure evening Charlie hope you're well
22:21
good to see you so that they're kind of the three structures I'd be looking for but I
22:26
think my my PR reference is something like this if we truly are going to go
22:33
higher on bitcoin then it's it's more so the fact that if we are already in a strong
22:41
trending environment which we should be because we've just broken out of a 67 month range then I don't feel as though
22:47
there's really much need to to kind of form this two-month consolidation period I'd been much
22:53
more um pleased to see this type of environment price pushes down to the to
22:59
the lows very very quickly bounces this was from January through to February so you have a period of 28 days 3 four
23:07
weeks of range by Price action and when price establishes support this is when
23:12
altcoins really picked up momentum back in 2021 so this is one environment this is my second preferred environment it
23:19
it's it's a sharp uh flush down strong reversal backup altcoins and Bitcoins
23:24
run together um in this environment Bitcoin ranges and ALT coins run and
23:29
then the third environment that I gave you which I really wouldn't want to see this but Bitcoin kind of trading
23:36
sideways in range for two months yes altcoins will do well but then I'm like okay well why is Bitcoin spending
23:42
another two months having just broken out of a range uh and and then we just remain range bound here for two months
23:48
I'm I'm not so sure how that would play out okay so that's kind of the scenario that I'm looking for now let's talk about my short okay ultimately it's a
23:55
hedge that's all it is it's not an outright short and if I'm looking to long from these
24:01
levels here then I'm looking to scale out my shorts here okay I'm not bothered about price trading into 883s and I've
24:08
closed on my short [ __ ] I've missed out on a bit of a move the fact is I've captured the majority of the game I've been long from
24:15
$554,000 I've not closed out uh any of my spot in fact what I've done and I
24:20
tweeted about this and I talked about this on stream last week is that I'm really looking for buying opportunities underneath BTC for the first time in a
24:27
very long time time so this is the Zone where I want to close my shorts in that 84 85 if it goes deeper and this fails
24:35
to hold then fine I'll probably look to close it out at the 83 level but I need to see a reaction I'm not blindly
24:41
closing out my shorts I need to see some form of reaction to suggest to me right okay this is held up nicely it's time to
24:49
cut my shorts and start looking for Longs on bitcoin okay I'm not just going to blindly close my shorts because hey guess what it's Trad into that level
24:55
it's all about the reaction and and and and even if we do get a reaction and it's shortlived and it rolls over then
25:01
fine I'll just wait until I get a strong enough reaction from the 83k level I'm not trying to nail the absolute bottom
25:08
I'm trying to give myself downside protection from this up move where I've locked in the gains and then step into
25:14
the market when I see enough strength to start looking for Longs again where I'm I wouldn't say wrong on the short idea
25:22
but where I where I would be looking to cut this short okay because like I said I'm just delta neutral at the moment
25:28
moment it's all right fine there's enough strength in the market to suggest this is just a shallow pullback and
25:34
Bitcoin pops back up so right now if I'm short from 99 my stop is over here and
25:40
so what if I get stopped out you know I haven't lost anything the point is that I'm playing the probability of of of of
25:47
giving myself downside protection such that the market pulls back and I can close the shorts in profit I've locked
25:54
in the gains managed my draw down and now I can flip long that's all is okay
25:59
so that's all the really is to it now moving moving out onto the the the
26:04
higher time frame just give me a second why am
26:10
I leaning towards continue downside well if you look at the EXO Trend scanner
26:15
coded by my good friend Charlie so if you want access to this indicator please deposit $10,000 into his account he'll
26:22
give you access to this otherwise you can search for it in trading view for free uh it's under X so uh
26:29
and I probably I probably um TR EXO mro TR scanner there you go BTC Charlie tra
26:36
XO microt TR scanner liked by 5,150 people okay so again when you look at
26:43
this on the 4 Hour we've just crossed the 12 and the 25 to the
26:48
downside when you look at what happens generally when Bitcoin crosses the 12
26:55
and the 25 in a trended market you can back test this you do get continued selling off
27:01
okay same again happened here it does sell off but this is more of a rangeb environment perhaps in the trend it's
27:08
slightly more shallower and shortlived let's go back to um 2021 let's see what happened
27:16
there you can see that Bitcoin topped at the highs crossed down we flipped beish
27:22
on the 4 Hour but it traded into a level of demand uh a demand Zone okay but when
27:28
you look at the so the point is I think for now it wouldn't surprise me if we do see further correction to the downside
27:35
on bitcoin um but like I said I think that presents opportunity it's not
27:40
something to be afraid of if you are sidelined on altcoins and we do get a flush lower down then that should give
27:46
you some buying opportunities over the coming weeks okay if you look at the daily the daily is fine there's a the
27:52
the 12 EMA the 25 is trading at $86,000 so don't be surprised if price
28:00
does drop lower down okay does drop lower down actually Springs un under the 12 and 25s trades
28:09
into that 83 84 level but it's very remember what I talked about in last week's streams about price remaining
28:16
under the bands in a bullish environment very very shallow price action below the bands the minute it flips that's a
28:22
momentum higher so don't be surprised if we see price trading below the bands the minute it pops back up that's your
28:28
continuation higher or at least back to range highs or a lower high and price
28:34
establishes that rangeb environment before we may see continuation higher okay this is not distrib this is not
28:41
distributive yet it's just a trended market trends don't become distribution in a matter of days and then break down
28:47
and fall down to $50,000 that is a very low probabilistic scenario and it's not
28:53
even one that I'm contemplating or on one that I certainly don't see coming to
28:58
fruition so for me this is just going to if it is going if we do see uh a stalling of the trend then this will be
29:04
somewhat of a consolidation corrective Range man environment and if that is the case then we will see momentum on
29:10
altcoins the final aspect that I want to touch about uh and I'm not going to delve into this too much but for those
29:17
of you who have watched my streams you you'll understand how I time bottoms with the stock RSI so again the key
29:24
concept is how can I increase the probability of being right using a
29:29
momentum or momentum based oscillators you've only got to look back on the
29:35
daily and you've only got to look back on how Bitcoin performs in trending environments when the stock RSI is at
29:41
the low so I think give or take another 3 four five six days this will probably
29:47
bottom up and we'll start see an oscillation maybe in December back to the highs okay it does take a few days
29:53
it can be extended for several days like this or it can be short and shallow like
29:58
this bottom bottom bottom bottom okay the lows again you got the lows lows
30:06
again and you've got the lows okay so you can see the Confluence notice that I'm not even talking about the tops why
30:13
am I not talking about the tops here because the fact is I'm looking for contextual
30:18
Longs I'm looking for inflection points and how to time the stock RSI
30:24
oscillating at the lows into a level of demand that's going to be a really good setup I feel okay even if it tags into
30:32
this mid-range that I've defined even if it Wicks below it gets back above stop at the low trigger back to the the local
30:39
Range High from 83 to 96 with some Confluence of
30:45
this the only time I pay attention to the tops is if we are really in a
30:51
downtrending or bearish environment or I'm looking to hedge off some risk okay which in this instance you can see the
30:59
RSI topped on the 12th of November but where is Price it's over here that was
31:04
not a reason to go short because you don't fade the trend when price has
31:09
broken out of a six-month range oscillators can remain overbought or
31:15
oversold right in Trends and if you look at this example the RSI the stock RSI
31:21
was trending lower as prices going higher but you will get those divergences where eventually momentum
31:26
will stall and eventually you will get a corrective move back down again okay so that's that and again if you look at the
31:32
macd I believe on The Daily that was um signaling yeah you're getting a level of
31:37
compression so whether we if we get a reset I'm not sure we'll have to wait and see but um just signs that we we
31:45
could see a correction for at least several days more okay or at least price ranges within this within this zone for
31:53
the next several days at least okay that's all there is to it
32:06
any questions I'm just looking at the chat but I'm just taking it really slow trying to explain my thoughts you know
32:13
just stay calm stay composed it's just another trade okay and um the best
32:19
trades are when price comes into those fantastic buying opportunities where you
32:24
see many people who have chased this rally to the upside for very little gay now okay there's a there's a real chance
32:31
that anybody who's just bought or longed you know 97 98 right telling you
32:38
that price is going to go to 120 with a stop at 94 what do you think is going to happen to them they're going
32:43
to get rattled they're going to piss their pants and and price will probably Cascade lower
32:52
down so like I said there was really no reason to Long Bitcoin I clearly stated
32:57
this on the timeline last uh on on stream last week that instead you want to be identifying buying
33:04
opportunities all right mate Charlie have a good one
33:11
buddy right let's move on eth BTC um like I said I I think this is going to
33:16
play out for a few more days we'll see where we are come Sunday now the next chart e BTC
33:33
what did we talk about on last week's
33:43
stream we said that price is into a monthly demand
33:52
Zone brilliant okay fantastic we said
33:58
price is also not just into a monthly demand Zone but also into a weekly
34:04
demand Zone and it's traded into that zone we
34:09
also said that look out for a bullish pin bar as a potential reversal on E BTC
34:17
you want to see a bullish pin bar close into a weekly monthly demand Zone that is probably some of the best risk reward
34:23
setup that you can get instead you could argue whether this this was a spinning
34:28
top candle or whether this is a dogee candle whichever you want to call it the
34:34
point is that for me I do believe that a there's a very good chance that if the
34:40
lows aren't in already then we're very close to a a significant reversal on eth
34:45
BTC whether this gives one more pullback but I do feel that we will see a a a
34:51
face ripping candle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
34:57
11 12 12 13 14 14 weeks of price action could very well be a raised in a
35:04
matter of weeks that's the risk that you face if
35:09
you're trying to show eth usdt which I've seen many people do on the timeline that's fine I personally
35:16
wouldn't be shorting e us C knowing that when Bitcoin if Bitcoin is to slowly
35:22
bleed lower down and E BTC show strength what do you think is going to happen
35:27
when bitco and find support and E has already showed significant dominance in
35:32
today's market where Bitcoin has rolled over for 67% but yet ether's caught a
35:39
bid tells you a lot about the market the current state of the market where
35:44
capital is rotating into eth okay and the strength on E BTC you don't want to fade this this is not the time to fade
35:50
it after one and a half years you're now thinking [ __ ] e BTC is bearish that's the wrong mindset this is opportunity or
35:57
you want to be identifying probable opportunity in the chart that's all there is that's literally all there is
36:03
to it I I could keep going on and on and on about e BTC but that's literally all there is to it and then when you look at
36:08
Bitcoin dominance right what's this telling you is it any
36:13
surprise that if BTC is moving up and Bitcoin dominance is moving
36:19
down okay so I really like the opportunity that we had have ahead of us on altcoins
36:27
and such that if Bitcoin does give you that rapid expansion to the downside now a fast cascading move into
36:32
8283 I think you will see some significant red days and alts maybe 10
36:38
20% moves down on altcoins but I do sense that they will be bought up very
36:44
very quickly they'll consolidate at the lows for two three days and then they will Spring higher as will as far as
36:51
long as ebtc continues to show that strength and you want to be observant of
36:57
what Bitcoin dominance is doing as well okay so just the two charts that I would
37:03
look at for understanding the contextual environment of altcoins is eth BTC we
37:09
know that when eth BTC performs to the upside that's generally a positive
37:14
environment for allcoins to perform to the upside as well and Bitcoin often remains range bound doesn't really do a
37:20
great deal so you've got to go for where the opportunity is where the volatility is where you're going to see those
37:26
higher beta players and that's alt coins right now okay for me so that's another point now let's
37:32
move on to Total two in fact let's look at total do not be surprised again very
37:39
confluent with Bitcoin total market cap has made new all-time highs do not be surprised if Bitcoin trades into that
37:46
83k level okay this is again you can't trade these charts but what these charts serve right I don't give a flying [ __ ]
37:52
what anybody else says I've been trading these markets for 7 years I know what works well for me I've nailed alt
37:59
markets every season every time I've played alt I've done very very well I've done well performed exceptionally well
38:05
to the upside and exceptionally well to the downside so I don't really care what other people have to say all I'm
38:11
concerned about is do I have a system which tells me when to be aggressive when to be defensive yes has that system
38:17
served my purpose over the years yes I don't need to be looking over my shoulder or looking over other people's
38:23
shoulder to see what their opinions are the chart tells me everything I need to know now and when you come to a point in
38:30
your trading career where you can make your own informed decisions that's when you're in full control of your own
38:36
actions you're accountable for your own actions you don't need to be looking at other people to find to figure out what
38:41
they're talking about you all you're only going to improve right honestly trust me on this you're only going to improve the day you switch off Twitter
38:48
you put your head down look at the screens look at the charts follow your own plans follow your own actions
38:53
understand your own validation points understand why you're looking to get into a trade that's when you're going to start seeing a real shift and
38:59
development of yourself as a Trader and you have to go through that process if you're currently in the market looking
39:05
for calls or signals from other people you're not going to make it it's as simple as that until you get that wakeup
39:10
call that reality check then fine and I'm not talking about buying a mem coin and hitting 200x that is not trading
39:17
that's just pure luck being in the right place at the right time and you've managed to throw $5,000 into a shitcoin
39:24
and in three weeks time it's probably worth a million dollars okay try doing that 100 times and see how far you get
39:29
the reality is it's not going to happen it's not a repeatable actionable event
39:35
that you can do for the next 10,000 trades okay so that's rant over but that's my point be self-sufficient
39:43
self-sufficient and be accountable for your own actions and the only way you're going to do that is understand uh price
39:49
action the charts what you're looking for what you're anticipating be realistic and secondly your mindset when
39:55
price comes to that level are you now going to have fear because you think price is going to break another 10 20 30% lower down okay or are you going to
40:02
start chasing tops where I saw last week people started to Long 97 98
40:09
99 okay ludicrous craziness to short long these levels up here when this was
40:15
looking fairly exhaustive okay so again looking at a total um if Bitcoin is to
40:23
pull into that 82 83 84k level you want to see this trade into this level maybe
40:28
it goes under and and flips back above maybe it doesn't maybe it just holds a support but again you're looking for
40:34
factors of Confluence you want to see price pushing away from this level whether it trades below it and then gets
40:39
back above or whether it trades into it and pushes away you want to chase that momentum back to the
40:47
upside so that's why it's a fact a factor of Confluence and then when you
40:53
look at total two again I'm looking for something very similar I already have this mapped out I
40:59
I shared this on the chart this is an Sr Zone okay let's just clear the chart clear
41:05
the shot whichever way you look at it where was the origin of this move down
41:11
it was here when price traded back into this
41:16
Zone what did what did price do sell off this is a massive inflection point
41:24
the fact that for the first time since this bull market we are now trading
41:30
considerably above that level the fact is that you should now if
41:36
you look at this this is a supply Zone price sold off retest of Supply sold off
41:42
aggressively retest of Supply sold off aggressively so this zone now is that
41:48
such that if Bitcoin and altcoins and ethereum do give a pullback this is the zone or the pocket
41:55
that you want to see acting as support support starts pushing away whether you want to buy this or it starts pushing
42:00
away you are now essentially trading the upper bound of this
42:09
range so look at the bigger look at the high time frame context ahead of
42:14
you secondly what's the trend scan say on the weekly we've just literally flipped
42:21
bullish the bands are training at 1.07 and 1.01 trillion if
42:27
this consolidates into here and these bands pushes up here you've got to buy that until it
42:35
fails go with the trends to the upside okay the trend the momentum is to the upside we've just had a corrective move
42:42
for seven months this is the expansion pullback continuation higher into these
42:48
highs look at what salana did
42:56
okay weekly pulls into the bands expansion shallow pullback continuation
43:18
higher now let's look at total three so the point I'm trying to make is that
43:23
contextually there are so many good setups out there so many very very very good
43:29
setups so again looking at this this is total three very similar to to what I showed on total and to well total two
43:37
there's your mid of this range here okay Supply Zone Supply Zone probably pull it down a bit there
43:44
we go okay we've just traded into that mid so any corrections now into month
43:50
end and early December with the let's just assume the December monthly opening is around here next week whilst prices
43:56
down down here that's a beautiful Pivot Point with the stop at the low first Target second Target in terms of high
44:03
time frame context again you can't trade total two total three but it it should
44:10
serve as the foundations of what the market is telling
44:18
you okay and then we've got others which I believe is fairly similar into that
44:23
Supply Zone but I suspect this will eventually CR Kaya we've seen a flow of capital into
44:30
cardano into xlm into xrp that Capital will rotate out of
44:37
there and come into midcaps and eventually low caps at some
44:45
point my stock RSI settings are standard there there's nothing different about what I
44:50
use rather than I've just ch change the color scheme
44:59
but again look at the monthly the monthly starting to point to the upside that looks fine you
45:06
know I I I really do like how this is shaping up so yeah overall look I I I
45:12
think opportunity is what I'm calling for continued opportunity we're just going to quickly cycle through some
45:17
altcoins now but I will start sharing trade setups again on Sunday stream when we have the monthly open um I think
45:24
that's really going to be a nice pivotal point but I'm just going to wh through look it's been a very very good week for me uh I think I've shared so many setups
45:31
on the timeline which have played out phenomenally well um we'll start off on tier a lot of
45:38
people are asking me EXO are you still in tier why is it not moving should I cut my position some of you just need to
45:44
learn patience and understand what bottom instructors look like and why they can take time and why I've always
45:51
said that you want to be buying the tail side of accumulation you don't want to be buying this [ __ ] here and then sit on
45:56
it for 6 months right this is where I want to do my I've been I've been talking about buying TI
46:01
here all the way through from uh September October November and then finally we get the pop out okay I do
46:07
believe that this will inevitably give a pullback will shift into a trend that's my target $12 take profit it might pull
46:16
back if it flips above back back above the $12 level guess what you now you've got this this entire Zone to trade so
46:22
I'm not just going to bag hole this all the way up and watch it come all the way back down I'll probably take
46:28
profit I've already taken 10% here just to pay myself something okay just to do
46:34
risk a slight amount but inevitably I'm looking to start playing futures of PS
46:39
over the next week or so because we've just broken out of the high time frame range any pullbacks into here I'll be
46:47
looking for leverage lungs up into $12 low leverage lungs okay uh if you look at Dime it's another
46:53
one that I've talked so many times look at that sideways you've had ample opportunity to
47:00
buy the lows every single time from this point ignore this that defined the lows
47:06
but you've had one two three opportunities to buy the lows and
47:12
literally trade the move up for 100% and this isn't this is not even finished
47:18
this in my opinion will comfortably get to
47:23
$360 and if you do get a sh pull back and look how strong altcoins are just look at this if you look at what Bitcoin
47:29
has done but get altcoins are holding up very very well look at e BTC
47:36
again is that something that you want to fade on a daily candle e BTC is breaking down e BTC is trading
47:43
quite okay let's look at e usct remember the um the chart that I
47:50
shared on on on on the timeline that where I'm looking for a pullback on ethereum and where it should trade next
47:56
next well we just smashed into our Target there long I close my hedges longed off 3100 straight into 35 I I'm
48:04
not looking to take profit on this if I do get a pullback fine as long
48:11
as I'm my stop is below here I'm looking for these highs up at
48:22
4,000 so whichever way you look at it
48:28
I shared my plans ahead of time um on the stream on the timeline and it's been a very very good
48:34
week very good
48:43
week there you go this was the uh the tweet that I shared on the 15th of
48:52
December basically I said I don't mind price wicking into 20 but ideally I want
48:58
to see 293,000 hold flip the mid into the highs there okay and that's essentially what we got
49:06
there's there's the lows there there's a level that was a swing from over here at 3,400 straight into 3,500 just below 36
49:15
just below 36 why we'll look left Supply Zone that's where price sold
49:21
off pullback aggressive sell off okay so we're into that Supply zone now so if if
49:26
there are any pullbacks it's because Bitcoin is trading lower down it's going to drag the market slightly lower but
49:32
what you're looking for and please pay attention to this strengthen altcoins okay Bitcoin can trade 83,000 it's just
49:39
dropped from let's just assume it goes to 83 right and it's traded 999,000 it's
49:45
just dropped $166,000 to 83,000 and all eth all eth
49:51
can do is just pull back into 3200 or maybe 3,000
49:57
that's strength in the market on altcoins especially eth which you should see continuation higher and if we do we
50:04
should get that compression and then pop into expansion into the highs okay that's what I'd be looking
50:11
for is that
50:23
clear all right well let's move on to some other alt coins say
50:29
no surprises it's I don't know what to say to you guys it's you
50:35
know I'm not going to sound like a broken record but it is what it is okay you've got to recognize that we've been
50:41
in a downtrend we're we're at the cycle lows here this was buying opportunity this was the higher low you've got to
50:47
buy these pullbacks it's Trend continuation high if you're asking me now EXO where can I get on and say I
50:52
don't know what to tell you the fact is you know I was vocally adamantly clear
51:00
that I'm buying say at these levels I've said it on stream all the way far back at September I've said it numerous times
51:07
on the timeline I'm looking for Price action to trade significantly higher I'm bullish on the market I'm bullish on
51:13
altcoins this is opportunity in the market okay this is not opportunity this
51:18
is where people get euphoric this is where people are fearing or alts are never going to run again you saw it in
51:23
the timeline July August altcoins are cooked they're not going to run again
51:29
bitcoin's going to take off but altcoins are going to perform it's the same [ __ ] every cycle same [ __ ] happened in November 2020 when I said it's going to
51:35
be another alt season and it was a month later all I saw was was comments no alts aren't going to roam they're not going
51:41
to perform very well Bitcoin is just going to tear away you know tear away well well what's happening now in the
51:47
market Bitcoin is going through a range of consolidation a correction and altcoins are showing strength in the
51:53
market any pullbacks are very very shortlived okay we've got that correction moved down at 700 p.m. UTC
52:00
into 59 cents and already it's
52:07
bouncing so I do suspect this will continue pushing higher I think Tia pushes higher um let's go over some of
52:14
the the charts that I shared last week desync hit the target is pulling back
52:24
okay it's right to 37 cents yep you're going to get a correction and
52:30
inevitably whether that's a high or low into this zone I'm looking for continuation into a trend we've been
52:36
range bound since May seven months May June July August September October
52:43
November 7 eight months of range bound price action in in a base building environment and and you think this is
52:49
just going to trade a range I'm looking for this to trade a trend into 64 cents using a range projection uh I talked
52:56
about Tai that's that's another one that I gave at down here I said uh to look for
53:03
the pullback 12 13 cents right you could have got in and where's it gone straight to 31
53:11
cents within 1 2 3 4 5 days six days um another one was vanry which was
53:18
at the cycle LS brilliant buying opportunity it's it's one that I like I said I invested
53:24
in 2020 I was in the pr sale when it used to be Terra virtu it it went from 4 cents to $120 obviously I took profit
53:32
and you know it's a project that I will continue to back every time it comes towards these buying opportunities just
53:39
because I'm I I I'm a backer of vanry doesn't mean that hey guess what guys when vanry goes all the way up here I'm
53:44
going to hold it and watch it come all the way back down if you think I'm going to do that and you think if that's how
53:50
the game is then I'm going to tell you no that's wrong that's [ __ ] of course I'm going to take profit but that doesn't stop me from
53:56
from from looking for opportunities to long this okay which again I covered on
54:02
last week's stream that look for pullbacks into the 87 cents looking for price to continue higher at least into
54:09
24 over the next several weeks that's what I'm looking
54:15
for um anyone is another
54:21
one literally shared it down here at $1 and it's at 160 that's the 60% gain
54:27
and I still feel as though this again look how I've identified look at the type of Trades I'm going for I'm not
54:34
talking about popart or Simon I'm talking about these price structures that have been range Bound for many many
54:41
months that you inevitably if the fundamentals are good enough right and it's why I've put my money into these
54:48
plays my own money because I'm backing one the fundamentals in a bull market to
54:53
push price higher okay you can have EXP exposure to these utility plays when
54:58
ethereum starts catching a bit these are going to catch a bit okay if you look at GTO um another
55:04
one that I'm in that I shared that's now hit 2/3 of the range we've been in since
55:10
the lower bounds over here literally where I've been sharing the setup
55:15
pushing away now this the objective here we pull back into the mid it might get below it back above monthly open
55:22
straight into $5 that's what I'd be looking for all this to get filled then we'll see what
55:28
happens
55:33
Jupiter slightly slower but inevitably I do believe it will get there you know
55:39
you've got to have patience in some of these playes there's your mid level give or
55:46
take into a corrective higher low you don't really don't want to see it break
55:52
structure uh higher low higher high in in comparison to this Wing higher low
55:58
higher high another higher low as long as this is respected that's an opportunity to go along into another
56:04
higher high pal I mean despite the [ __ ] show
56:12
that they that they went through this this really needs to get above 20 cents I feel as though this was a horrific
56:19
[ __ ] up by the team it was an awful um P [ __ ] up if I'm really honest but
56:27
look you know I haven't sold any I'm still holding I want to see AI kicking
56:33
and once it does I think pile can go above 20 cents trade back into this range here that's where I'd be looking
56:39
for a December so just because you know this happened doesn't mean that the
56:44
project is flat on its hor the team's made an announcement they're doing BuyBacks so you know I'm glad they've
56:51
kind of put that in the past now with with with with with the uh awful community Comm unication and hopefully
56:57
we we will see strength now along with the AI narrative on on pal so talking
57:02
about AI coins we can look at to to's another one okay so just kind of
57:07
going sideways and a range again I think this is a corrective pattern it's been
57:12
in this range for the best part of September October November so nearly uh two
57:20
months I think inevitably when this is
57:25
ready I'm looking for prices to continue trading
57:30
higher uh let's look at fetch fetch is another one so you can see these uh AI coins are not quite
57:37
ready they are still range bounds okay but inevitably you want to see price
57:43
fetch you want to see trading into 260s it needs to get above 180 to open the floodgates to go to 240 250 but this is
57:51
just corrective you know they'll have their run I'm sure they will
58:00
E usct I I I think goes to 4,000 I like I said there's my chart on E I'm looking
58:06
for price to trade back into here and then we can talk about alltime
58:17
highs I do want to suggest one thing that you guys should start
58:22
doing we have been looking at the e or alt us pairs any ideas what suggestion
58:29
I'm going to make next to gauge Market strength on an altcoin I've talked about this so many
58:34
times on stream and on the timeline and I think it's just such a simple little trick that people forget and I I don't
58:42
see many people talking about it on the timeline yet again but if you really want to identify strength and ALT coins
58:49
what do you think that might be
58:56
correct well done well done
59:02
belint alt btz paers yep well done Ken you really want to look look let me show
59:08
you something right we talked about t okay I've talked
59:13
about how I've been positioning into this I'm looking for price to trade higher I've built my spot position I've been sat in here for many many weeks
59:20
four five weeks it's just made almost 100% move from my entry One Trade four weeks and people
59:29
lack patience but the key to this look at what the uh tier BTC chart
59:36
was telling you bottom here started to reclaim above
59:42
and what happens when we got the reclaim pushed up higher okay short live deviation this was the
59:49
SR level over here there you go
59:57
pushes above the minute look at that the minute it pushes above 1 2 3 4 shakes
1:00:02
people out on a few uh several days ago and then it pops higher now if you look
1:00:08
at the tier usdt chart it would it would have been this
1:00:14
move here yet this is a higher low and then it takes off so notice how how some
1:00:20
real strength can kick into the market but notice how you can use the confidence of all BTC pairs
1:00:27
um even if you look at something like dying BTC
1:00:33
again it printed a lower low below here it was very very short lived two days
1:00:41
two days right that one two days 3 days
1:00:46
that in itself the minute you see this probable reclaim is a reason to go along so look for these structures and ALT
1:00:52
coins seriously you'll you'll find a lot of success with
1:01:02
these NL all right I mean this is one I invested in so disclaimer but yeah I
1:01:08
mean not great you know it's Fallen all the way from 283 down to 12 cent so I'm
1:01:15
not going to say much more than this other than that I am an investor um I invested in the Ico round or private
1:01:22
sale round my tokens are still locked investing and they probably will be locked out I'm not sure for how long but
1:01:28
I guess at least one of the few few months maybe five six months so you know it is what it is that's the people think
1:01:35
that getting into private seals is easy money it's not you look at this [ __ ] and
1:01:41
yet my tokens are still locked so I could still potentially miss if price goes higher I could still miss this
1:01:47
upside and I'm still kind sell my tokens because I don't have them they locked in the vesting
1:01:53
schedule uh tensor tensor is another one that look great I agree yeah it looks good honestly I I
1:02:00
really do think tenser has every possibility or feeling in this up to
1:02:08
here if things get silly it they will get very very silly right um I'm going
1:02:14
to spend five more minutes on the stream can't believe an hour and 10 is already pass
1:02:20
by um I want to talk about one aspect and I think this is a nice seg way into
1:02:26
Sunday stream about distribution taking profits I want you guys to be realistic
1:02:33
okay I don't know what's going to happen but what I can tell you
1:02:39
is look back at any altcoin chart okay look back at altcoins in February March
1:02:46
in
1:02:52
2021 you have the stealth phase you have thew wance phase you have the Mania phase you have the blow
1:02:59
phase my first question to you is guys I just really want you to pay
1:03:04
attention this because this I feel the next four to six weeks is either going to make you or break
1:03:10
you right and my question to you guys is of these four
1:03:18
phases which looks to be the shortest in a bull market
1:03:47
all right look in my point in my opinion I feel as though we're here media attention people are talking about
1:03:52
Bitcoin there's enthusiasm in the market now right would you agree I'm not talking about Bitcoin I'm
1:03:57
talking about altcoins here not Bitcoin um would you agree that there's media retention there's enthusiasm the public
1:04:04
is starting to get evolved you seen people talk about memes on Tik toks Tik Tok memes coming into crypto right so
1:04:12
look the point I'm trying to make is that this is the most aggressive fastive
1:04:17
uh fastest expansion phase in the market and it generally is for like four to 6
1:04:24
weeks where you get the me 80% of the move is likely to happen in 4 to 6 weeks
1:04:30
on on a given altcoin if you look
1:04:37
at
1:04:43
tier starting from here one two three four five pullback six seven
1:04:50
weeks and then multiple weeks of selling
1:04:59
you see that yeah you look at
1:05:05
op consolidation one this was back in
1:05:10
uh December January one two
1:05:15
three four weeks right why four weeks why why am I not
1:05:22
including these here why am I only including the four just just from one 2
1:05:27
3 4 because if you look at the peak the peak was here and then it did nothing
1:05:33
for one 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 nine weeks back
1:05:38
to the range highs is it fair to call this or fair to assume this is an up thrust after distribution yes because
1:05:47
it's shortlived gets back inside and it bleeds so what can you what's what's the takeaway from all of this look at the
1:05:52
previous uh cycle one okay this this is the base breaks out the base 1 2 3 4
1:06:00
weeks has it done anything since thereafter for the next several weeks no
1:06:05
it hasn't so the point is those aggressive
1:06:12
moves that I just covered in the Mania phase happens fast happens relentlessly
1:06:18
quick and it doesn't waste any time and I'll give you another example I know this for a fact look at pal
1:06:26
one two let me just start
1:06:32
again there's the Bas one two 3 four weeks aggressive price
1:06:38
action price went from 11 cents to nearly 90 cents in four
1:06:44
weeks and then weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of
1:06:50
bleeding so the reality is and you can go back to December 2017 January 2018 go
1:06:58
back and look at altcoins look at Neo for example right for those of you who traded Neo back then
1:07:06
um it's the same [ __ ] every time it's the same [ __ ] every
1:07:14
time I traded this from I think $11 to 180 and I sold I literally sold 180 and
1:07:21
and back then I I I really wasn't clued up about ta I just thought yeah this is up a lot I'm just going to take some
1:07:27
profit on this pure luck I did not know it was going to be the top of the market but again when you look at
1:07:33
this this is your base for seven months right this is August 2017 this is November the 27th breaks
1:07:42
out in December right there's the first break out of the range first week of
1:07:48
December one 2 3 4 five
1:07:54
weeks the top was in that sixth week and then you get
1:07:59
the slow bleed down again hence why I keep iterating the point that I don't know what's going to happen
1:08:06
but if we get explosive moves in December into January over four to six
1:08:11
weeks just remain cognizant of the inefficient moves to
1:08:16
the upside and how often they get retraced to the downside okay manage your risk know when to cash out if you
1:08:23
can do that you will not be one of those people is going to hold it all the way back down again go back do the charts
1:08:29
that's your homework you'll figure it out but understand when you start seeing these types of mania phases and I feel
1:08:35
as though like many altcoins are literally here still in
1:08:40
this Zone about to break out some are starting to push up okay but that's kind of where I feel where we
1:08:46
are if you look at this this was the cycle in 2021 again I I just feel on
1:08:52
some of the utility coins we're kind of in this Zone here now pushing away and we're gonna get Silly Season hopefully
1:08:59
we get Silly Season I'm not saying we will do because I shouldn't be speaking in absolutes uncertainties but this is
1:09:04
the opportunity ahead of you don't be afraid of opportunity um cuz you don't look back
1:09:11
in four five weeks and start buying these highs because you know what it's too late you should have been buying
1:09:16
these lows and positioning into alt coins then okay um let's look at Shido cardano
1:09:24
because that's interesting one um what's this P of crap doing was did any any of you guys ever
1:09:32
watch my streams when I short this about nearly $3 and I was being told it's going to go to 10 I don't know if
1:09:38
anybody was watching my streams in in in the summer of 2021 um that was a
1:09:43
beautiful sh all the way back it was such an easy short it really was I shouldn't I shouldn't laugh but it
1:09:49
really was it was just um it just too much of Ane efficient I mean come on let just be realistic look at this [ __ ]
1:09:56
right when you see this type of stuff on the charts all this is thinner all this is
1:10:03
thinner Look At That Swing fail get us back inside you can just whack us up
1:10:08
there short this first Target is filling all this inefficiency at least down into
1:10:13
this level here doesn't matter about the time
1:10:19
frame price is fractal whichever way you look at it
1:10:26
it's just painful to hold because it is a slow bleed down it takes multiple weeks but eventually it gets there so
1:10:33
what is like a couple of weeks on the way up it takes forever in a day to just get all the way back down again you
1:10:38
you'll see this again in next year once once this Al alt cycle or alt season plays out and it's over you're going to
1:10:45
see the same [ __ ] happen over and over and over again okay so my my next stream
1:10:51
will be talking about how I identify ways to exit markets uh looking for
1:10:56
pattern of distribution and I think it's it's quite good to do because I want you guys to be equipped or tooled or have
1:11:03
the knowledge or the insights to recognize risk downside risk when to capitalize on profit when to get out the
1:11:09
market and and you'll be one of the few people actually does well um having captured the upside capturing the upside
1:11:16
and having unrealized profits doesn't mean anything you then have to convert those unrealized profits into realized
1:11:21
profits and avoid this type of significant draw down all right so I'm going to leave you out that folks I think that's good enough for today uh
1:11:28
just a reminder on Sunday's stream we'll be covering altcoin trade setups in
1:11:33
further detail um I just feel as though altcoins are in a position
1:11:39
where I just want to see slightly more of a pullback if there is going to be a pullback that I'd want to share with you the last thing I want to do is start
1:11:45
sharing altcoin trade setups that are that are into resistance or tops and then price pulls back 20 30% you're like
1:11:52
hey EXO you should the top you [ __ ] [ __ ] so I want to give you the higher
1:11:57
probability plays maybe we get something set up very early in December with the December monthly open maybe Bitcoin
1:12:03
trades into 83k perhaps then I probably will feel comfortable sharing uh altcoin
1:12:09
trade setups so we'll look at patterns of distribution how to exit Market looking for top signals some of the strategies that I use and then how to
1:12:15
switch context from longs to shorts outright shorts okay apart from that have a great uh week ahead uh stay
1:12:21
blessed in your trading just be cognizant of any downside on bitco Co but again like I said with that will
1:12:27
that should present buying opportunities in the chart uh and identify which which which markets you want to trade on
1:12:33
essentially let's just hope fingers crossed that ethereum continues showing strength all right so that's it for me
1:12:39
God bless I'll catch you on Sunday Sunday evening stream where we will uh talk about
1:12:44
December the monthly open trade setups and all of the other topics that I've just listed here God bless take care
1:12:50
peace out for
