testing one two testing one two good evening everybody just doing a quick audio check first of all if you can give
0:43
me confirmation in the chat that you can hear my voice and see my screen and
0:48
we'll proceed ahead with today's session
1:01
are we good good to continue fantastic all right so as always a special thank you to Prime xbt
1:08
for once again sponsoring the weekly live streams as
1:13
always anything said in today's video is not Financial advice it is just my view
1:18
of the market okay all right awesome so before we proceed I just want to give
1:23
you a quick update with regards to the uh the group that we're going to launch
1:28
in a few weeks time so just a quick summary for those of you who have been bombarding me with messages in the DMS
1:36
so to give an update the last public stream from me will be next Sunday
1:43
that's Sunday the 23rd that will be the last stream until the foreseeable future
1:48
I'm not sure when I will be back it could be at some point towards the end
1:53
of Q2 maybe I might do the odd oneoff stream here and there to be confirmed
1:59
but yeah today is the second to last stream and next week will certainly be the last stream okay and then we move
2:05
over on to the the four-week mentorship which I'm doing in in
2:10
partnership with OK exchange and Prime xbt so in terms of the group access
2:18
let's just kick off a lot of people asking me where are the registration forms so the registration forms will be
2:24
made available later this week most likely tomorrow evening if if you come
2:30
back to this video uh you'll see a link to the Google forms in the description of the video so make sure that you do
2:36
not click on any comments or any replies suggesting to sign up I will leave a
2:43
Google form for you guys to fill in and to follow the instructions on how to get them boarded and for those of you who
2:49
are struggling with the onboarding process that's not a problem I'd like to get everybody in board so whatever
2:55
teething issues are present we'll get them resolved okay one one by one if we have
3:00
to do so so the onboarding process happens will start on the 24th of
3:05
February it's going to be running on substack so I do advise all of you who wish to join or wish to register um to
3:13
set up a substack account and then the onboarding process will happen as of the
3:18
24th and then we actually go live on on Sunday the 2nd I was hoping to start on
3:23
on the 24th but I I realized with the teething issues I probably need to give
3:29
perhaps a little B more time for the onboarding process okay so sign up is via OK exchange or prime xbt link so you
3:36
can find those in the corresponding videos whether it's a stream sponsored by prime or it's a stream sponsored by
3:43
okay exchange the criteria is that you deposit 500 and you hit a threshold of a
3:49
minimum of $500 uh dollar of trading volume and like I said I'm not looking to profit from this all proceeds will be
3:57
given to charity uh and like I said this is just for me to give something back to the community before I take a fairly
4:03
decent break from most aspects of social media and streaming so moving forward
4:09
just to summarize what the course is going to be about we're going to talk about my 2025 trading manual water down
4:15
just to give you guys the foundation of of what a trading manual looks like we look at the trade planning and life
4:21
cycle that I I I personally go through each and every week when I'm trading the markets and then we look look at trading
4:27
systematization so basically what does a trade trading system look like what does a trading strategy consist of how can
4:33
you go about developing your own strategy and like I said we'll touch upon the basics of price time flow uh
4:40
we'll talk about execution strategy using Footprints as well because that's certainly one thing that I've never really covered or talked about on stream
4:46
I've always focused on the aspects of price action because ultimately price action is is what's key for me
4:53
understanding the context but what I want to do is give a granular overview of how I actually execute trades using
5:01
Footprints okay particularly for Bitcoin not so much for altcoins and then we'll we'll cover trade setups as we normally
5:07
do on these weekly streams um overall looking to run two to three private
5:12
streams or recordings per week uh we will bring back the Sunday market reviews which will include the global
5:20
markets Outlook and the macro outlooks as well like I used to do we'll talk about the basics of auction Market
5:25
Theory which is a precursor before we go into orderflow footprint Market profile
5:31
Etc all right so that's it in in in summary so for those of you who are
5:36
having issues with the signup process um like I said if you just bear with me another day or so the Google form will
5:42
be available so if there are any issues there will be an option for you guys to to leave a comment as to what those
5:48
issues are and I will forward it forward those uh requests over to the team and get them to work on those individually
5:55
on a caseby Case basis okay are we all clear
6:02
any questions around that is that is that fairly um straightforward if not then just leave a comment in the chat or
6:09
after the video leave a comment on the video and uh I'll pick it
6:15
up okay so I think today's session really nothing has changed significantly
6:22
from when I last streamed just give me one second yeah so yeah basically look it's
6:29
it's a case of where for for those who are asking in the chat um you have to
6:35
deposit an amount of $500 and then hit your trading threshold so basically taking a trade you know if you want to
6:41
open it close it whatever you want to do it's it's entirely up to you but that's kind of the criteria that has to be met
6:46
for you guys to be eligible um and like I said the the other thing that I should probably make you aware of is is that
6:54
you probably will need to kyc so if you're uncomfortable with kyc then unfortunately it's not going going to be
6:59
for you okay now you haven't missed much CL I've just literally started so let's look at
7:06
Bitcoin to begin with we'll start off on the high time frame I think the last stream that I did was on o uh was it
7:12
February the 4th I believe so it was round about
7:18
here we had the aggressive sell off on the 3D on the next weekly open we we had
7:24
the candle open okay so it was round about the February the 4th that I last
7:29
stream dreamed and if you recall what I said my view is such that we've we've
7:35
got the December highs we've got the December lows somewhere around
7:42
here that's the range that I'm essentially focusing on um and
7:48
ultimately what I'm looking for is that I'm trying to be objective about price yes I can appreciate that you know the
7:56
market isn't really looking great at these highs yes Bitcoin is holding up fairly well but there seems to be a lot
8:02
of concern about downside risk and Bitcoin breaking down and then you've got the other half of the audience which is talking about we're still in the bull
8:08
market uh this is all consolidation before we go higher my honest opinion
8:14
and being very very objective not speculative but being very objective is that I I don't know what's
8:21
going to happen next and all I can do is as a Trader is that you won't see me
8:27
talking about the fact that Bitcoin is is likely to go to 68,000 next that's it the top is in because it doesn't really
8:34
do anything for me it's not actionable all I can look at is what is the information in front of me at this very
8:41
moment in time and which are the levels that I can interact with where I need to see a reaction for a possible trade
8:48
setup that's all I'm looking for okay let's just assume that I don't have any
8:53
positions and I'm looking for a trade setup so we we we talked about last week
9:00
in terms of this demand Zone being key uh I don't mind price revisiting lower
9:05
down into the 929k region potentially for a
9:10
reaction um and the key to this was the fact that look I think there's a case
9:16
where if you look at where price is in terms of the lower time
9:21
frame it wouldn't surpris me if we see some of this getting back fied
9:26
okay potentially down into the range quarter so if you look at the previous trading range we've got the December
9:33
lows we've got the December highs and we've also got the mid level over here okay that's essentially a key pivotal
9:40
point now what's important about this key pivotal level is that if you look at
9:47
the time spent above the 100K level it was very
9:53
shortlived where did price reject from it rejected from that 100K level and
9:58
like I said if price is likely to get rejected from here then we could see a retracement going back down at least
10:05
towards if you look at the area where the the majority of price action has occurred it's this region here okay
10:12
because if you look at the highs look at the lows again we've just been oscillating in this Zone here so the
10:21
question is whether whether I get the trade setup that I've been looking for and I've been
10:26
very very patient on this I've not had anything to action I've had nothing to trade on bitcoin it's been fairly stale
10:33
and what I'm looking for is effectively if I was to take this as a range
10:39
quarter again it's a fairly decent level again which is quite pivotal you can see it's acted as support support and
10:46
again some level of choppiness but the there is enough contextual environment
10:52
to suggest that this could be one of the key levels okay where I could be looking
10:57
to do business if I get a trade point so just to reiterate this there's two areas that I'm looking to trade essentially on
11:04
bitcoin long story short either we're going to get a shallow pullback into this Zone here I get acceptance back
11:10
above that could be one trigger point but I need to see acceptance fairly
11:15
quickly back above the mid level okay I want to see buyers step into the market
11:20
it's a term known as initiation where you can see on the footprints that buyers are stepping into this
11:26
aggressively shorts are getting squeezed out their position low whoever's been shorting this that's essentially what I
11:32
want to look for that initial impulsive move up initiation sh shallow
11:37
consolidation and then we see continuation higher my favorite setup is
11:43
price trading lower down below this lower bound potentially getting close to
11:50
or taking out this low here whether we take it out or whether we just stopped short again I covered that scenario in
11:56
last week's video in detail in terms of execu strategy so please I'm not going to repeat myself if you wish to I I
12:03
would highly advise you to go and watch that video because I covered all this scenario in in detail in granular level
12:09
in terms of price action how I would look to execute the trade and what are the scenarios that I'm looking to trade
12:15
so overall there's not really a great deal to talk about unfortunately in Bitcoin I was hoping that we would see
12:21
further price development but when you look at the daily range when you look at the daily
12:26
time frame it's it's not been great if in all honesty it's not been great at
12:32
all so moving forward sorry just be with me a
12:43
second moving forward currently where we are so I've just switched off the replay tool kind of reiterated the setup that I
12:51
wanted to see before um which which I covered on the previous stream now where are we one
12:57
week later 10 days later I streamed on the fourth 12 Days Later with on the wiser okay I've not had anything
13:04
actionable I've not had any setups triggered just yet and I'm not sure what's going to happen
13:11
in all honesty I couldn't tell you we just seem to be in this period of low
13:16
volatility but I've defined the levels and and that's all I can do is just wait for their reaction wait for some form of
13:23
whether Bitcoin trades drops into this lower bound
13:29
runs the lows here if there's any stops here they get taken out reclaims back inside that's the trigger like I said we
13:35
want to see initiation the second part is well what if we we we get close to
13:41
this level this is the second Zone where I want to do business or whether we get an aggressive fast move down with
13:49
momentum with aggressive selling at the lows late shorts get trapped anybody
13:55
who's holding their long puke and then price reims back above this key low here
14:01
or this key low here they're the two swing points you've also got December's low so could this
14:07
be an under and back over I'm not sure what I would what I'm leaning towards in
14:13
terms of a possible scenario is such that I'm not sure if we're going to get
14:20
the trade setup so if it is going to be a fast move down I want it to be shortlived and get back inside okay if
14:27
it's just going to move down very quickly and hover around here and start rolling over that's a course of concern
14:33
then we probably trade much lower into this Zone here but until this scenario happens I can't say for certain that
14:40
we're going to break down and equally I can't say for certain that this level is going to hold all I can do is React to
14:47
what the market presents such that even if I took this trade on assume that we do get an aggressive seller for whatever
14:54
reason price reclaims I take the long my inv validation here if this starts rolling over I have to quit the trade
15:01
very very tight stop the reason I have a tight stop is because I talk about a three strike rule I'm happy to take a
15:07
small loss I don't have to take a one hour loss and wait for my stop to get trigger down here if price shows me
15:13
strength and such that this was kind of a run of the previous swing low and we've decided to run these lows before
15:20
we get back inside I'll just St back into the trade almost the same trade setup just a slightly different reason
15:25
to execute the trade because this was a stop run on these before price reverts back up okay alternatively like I said
15:32
if I'm wrong and price stops me out or I cut the trade here and it rolls over
15:37
then I have to switch context and potentially think about either longing from lower down or if I see enough
15:43
reason where price rejects off this level Underside retest rejects again
15:48
then I'll have to ride the short down into wherever price wants to trade next into this 8K level okay but like I said
15:55
that's kind of the um we're we're a few levels away from this scenario playing out but it's just something that I want
16:01
you to keep in the back of your mind now what I'm thinking and I'm still leaning
16:06
towards this possibility and again this is just purely it's not objective it's more just gut
16:12
feeling it's more what I think could happen but is it really being objective
16:18
no it's not being objective what I'm leaning towards is potentially the laws holding
16:24
around here somewhere just somewhere in this Zone here where we don't quite necessarily come down and take out these
16:30
lows but what we may do is
16:37
essentially take out this set of low these set of lows here
16:42
okay so I've just been waiting for something substantial because if you if you think about this as a if you think
16:48
of this as a range all I'm looking for is price to
16:54
come down tap into 9392 get back inside that previous range
17:00
that should be enough of a invalidation point let's go higher okay into that
17:05
third Drive higher up and then we'll see what happens okay whether it's a shallow pullback
17:11
continuation higher or whether that was it that was the third drive one two
17:17
three okay you've probably seen the wickoff schematics flying around Could
17:22
Happen may not happen okay I don't really care all I need to see is what kind of reaction I'm going to get
17:29
should price drop lower down now the question is what if it doesn't what if price doesn't trade lower down what if
17:35
price doesn't run this local range low here that's fine it's it's not part of my system it's not part of my strategy
17:42
I've already explained my current position where I've been long on spot from the
17:48
lows in September and I've hedged out where we talked on stream about looking
17:55
looking to potentially short this or hedge out and that's essentially what I've done so I'm still delta neutral
18:00
because I don't have anything very I don't have anything definitive as as to what the market is likely to do next but
18:07
what I do know is that should the price trade into the zones that I wish to see it trade and give me a reaction and I'm
18:14
looking at the flow and the footprints then I have a reason to execute the long
18:20
I'll close up my head short which is against my spot and I'll be aggressive in looking for Longs in the market
18:26
ideally that's the scenario that I'd like to see all right is there any questions around
18:40
this now in terms of the market what does give me a level of
18:45
concern is if price cannot find
18:51
acceptance Above This 104k level and what do I mean by
18:57
that what I mean is that should price trade Above This level again and reject and then close back
19:07
inside I think that then increases the probability that we are very close to an
19:14
inflection point and a potential reversal point in the market for a
19:19
corrective move okay so if we trade higher watch for the sentiment to become
19:25
bullish and the minute we reject this is what you want want to be looking at this 104 level
19:32
okay so that 104 level is essentially coming in around here so are we going to get a pushup drop lower down pushup
19:40
reject close back inside and then now we likely see continuation low down that's just the downside risk that you have to
19:47
be aware
19:55
of just want to quickly move on to the uh the stocks looking at the weekly one
20:01
thing I've talked about on the previous streams would anybody like to chip in and recall what I said about the weekly
20:07
stock and price trading into December's low I went over this in detail over the
20:15
last few streams what to look for what to observe and that look if Bitcoin can
20:21
consolidate at this level here and the weekly on the stocks is oscillating at
20:28
the but there's no continuation momentum as long as we don't see that momentum in
20:33
Breakdown or acceptance below the 93k level because if you look at price again
20:39
this is another key level to Mark out on the chart I'll do this in blue but if
20:44
you look at the weekly time frame we have not yet had a single weekly close
20:51
below that 93k level so again another reason why just using the high time
20:57
frame I've marked out the the lows on
21:03
December December lows okay the lowest
21:08
weekly close within this range is at 93 we've got the December Highs at
21:16
108 they're the key levels that I'm looking to play and pivot off around okay and then we've got this key mid
21:23
level at that 100K Zone okay that is essentially the range on the high time
21:29
frame the key levels that I'm looking at and that's on a weekly basis so like I
21:34
said if there is a reason for me to Long price it's going to be in this Zone here
21:41
between that 90 to 92 93k level if price
21:47
does take out this weekly low acceptance back above it that's
21:53
going to be a trigger for me to go long okay with an invalidation like I said it can be below here it can be below here
21:59
it it just depends on what the market are we going to swing fail this low or are we going to swing faill this low and
22:05
find acceptance that's where as a Trader you have to react to the data points
22:11
that the market gives you okay I'm not predicting what's going to happen I'm
22:18
literally talking through the scenarios where I would be interested in doing
22:23
business I have explained why how and what I'm looking for so I'm looking for PR price to take out a previous low I'm
22:30
looking for shorts to aggressively start piling in but passive bids are absorbing
22:36
any aggressive selling sellers are getting exhausted at this level price to then show me strength to reclaim back
22:42
above 94 or 91 91.5 similar scenario run
22:49
the lows get back inside I want to see initiation buy a stepping in shorts getting trapped they're going to unwind
22:54
their shorts they're going to puke price pushes higher okay so that's all can do and there's a very good possibility
23:01
right and this is where you have to accept as a Trader that you may not even get a setup which is absolutely fine if
23:08
the market doesn't give me the setup that I'm looking for then I have nothing to act upon and that's where being
23:14
patient comes in having discipline comes in but also having a plan B that if you wish to attack the market aggressively
23:21
where are you looking to get on so that's something that you guys need to think about yourself you don't necessarily have to the follow the plans
23:27
that I'm looking to take some of you may wish that all right if we don't run the
23:34
laws maybe for you guys an a point of um getting on board would be acceptance
23:42
above this mid level here okay that's valid if that's part of your system you go ahead and do that for me it's it's
23:49
slightly choppy here I again like I said I like to look for those um aggressive
23:55
participants getting trapped in the market and price rever either the way so it's more of a mean reversion strategy
24:01
that I try to play that's one of my favorite strategies
24:06
okay yeah like I said I've just explained what if I don't get the retest I'm fine it's not my setup I don't have
24:12
any Edge I know what works well for me and I know what works well for my trading
24:18
system but there's many many different styles as you can come with your own strategies you may even be a day trader
24:25
there's plenty of trading opportunities within this if it suits your system but this does not suit my system because
24:32
one we're not even at the mid of the range we're not at the lower bounds of the range so I don't have anything
24:37
really to action and I know for a fact that over the past my trading data that I look at the
24:46
qualitative and and quantitative analysis tells me that most of my best trades when it comes to range B
24:51
environment is at the extremities but not only is it just at the extremities it's then knowing right
24:58
this is the key point it's not just about all prices at the range lows it's about knowing what I'm looking for at
25:04
this moment in time in terms of the flow the footprint where the shorts are
25:10
aggressively opening into passive bids and if they are are what's the possibility that they're likely to go to
25:17
get trapped or are shorts being aggressive passive bids are unable to
25:23
absorb the aggressive selling price consolidates we get a breakdown Underside retest anybody who's longing
25:30
this now is looking to get the [ __ ] out this now caps price to the upside because you're probably looking to get
25:36
out break even and there's initiation for the continuation lower down okay because anybody who's long in this is
25:42
now offside they're waiting if they haven't been stopped out they're hoping to get back out of the market if they
25:47
see a rejection what do you think they're going to do for every long that you open to close that long you have to
25:53
open it on the oppos opposite side of the trade which is going to cause what cor selling pressure so short are piling
25:58
in Longs are offside they're going to be closing and that's what causes these moves down breaking out of that range
26:06
I'm not saying this is what's going to happen I mean just explaining the Dynamics of how markets work and
26:12
essentially what you need to look for in terms of risk to the downside if you are looking to play the long scenario which
26:19
I am all right but overall from a from an
26:25
analysis point of view not from an actionable point of view I I do like how this weekly soccer RSI
26:32
is hovering got the lows and yet price is still contained in here but again another way of looking at this is if we
26:38
get a break of this trend line here then we are in a level of [ __ ] so just something to be wary
26:46
of in terms of the daily I can't really gauge much from the daily whether this is going to roll over one more
26:53
time and then we might get our set up okay
26:59
are we going to trade the extremes on either side that's what I'm hoping we do
27:04
I hope we remain range bound but we'll have to wait and see moving on to the uh
27:10
the bands the trend
27:15
scanner like I said yes it's a backr on The Daily but as I've alluded in the past that we
27:24
are hovering under the bands okay we're not a million miles away we're not seeing expansion away from the bands
27:30
okay we're just hovering under the band so expectations for the weeke continuous
27:37
chop continuous grind I'm not really expecting too much to happen in the market I think there's every case that
27:44
like I said we could come down and take out these lows and in doing
27:50
so does this establish the early lows of the week before we get acceptance back
27:55
inside the range okay if we do then I think it's probable that we end up
28:01
trading the the higher bound of the range okay back into that 101's that key midlevel that I keep talking about
28:09
that's that's what I feel the range is likely to be until we get real aggressive initiation and
28:15
expansion above this mid level of 100K then we can probably see a a probability
28:22
that price will trade back into that 108 109 110 maybe higher over the next few
28:27
weeks into to this level then the the key question is okay if we do that is
28:33
this likely to be the third drive so we get a a pullback into that level a
28:40
reaction continuation higher or that's it that's all we get okay is
28:49
that all we're going to get before we see a a larger corrective move down take
28:54
taking out the opposite side of the range on this side here okay just something to think about but these
29:01
are very very good trading ranges at the extremities whichever way you look at
29:07
it but we're like I said we're a long way of any of this happening just yet
29:13
okay for now this is all we've got to work
29:20
with I'm just looking through the chat see if there's any questions
29:28
why 104k level not 106 or 102 well for me why the 104k level
29:37
um what's that one oh because like I said if you look at the weekly chart and this is why I always talk
29:43
about mapping out the charts on the higher time frame is have we
29:49
had a weekly closeup of 104 so pav I hope that answers your
29:56
question have we had a week L close above 104 no we haven't have we had a
30:01
weekly close below 103 over the last several weeks no we haven't so where is
30:07
the market contained it's contained between these two levels so what I'm basically saying is that if you see if
30:15
you look at these Wicks here buyers are stepping into the market if you look at the Wicks at the other side of the range
30:20
sellers are stepping into the market okay classic range trading me reversion
30:27
play you long the lows you short the highs okay so the question is are we going to
30:33
get one more push down if so we want to see acceptance back above this key Zone take the trade on mean reversion trade
30:39
continuation higher are we going to run the highs or or get close to running the highs here rejection back inside M
30:46
reversion trade back to the mid that's what I'm looking for until there's a clear direction of continuation higher
30:54
or continuation lower into a trend trending environment okay but we haven't got a training
31:00
environment and that's a mistake a lot of people make when they latch onto a trade they're looking for that big
31:06
expansive move out of a range into a trend but it doesn't happen price ranges 80% of the
31:12
time sorry price ranges 80% of the time if not more and
31:18
Trends far significantly less you've only got to look at the examples here is
31:24
that this was May 2022 this is the range that we had until October 23 a year and a half of almost
31:32
rangeb price action your Trend was this for several weeks consolidation again 1
31:39
2 3 4 5 weeks of trend long form consolidation again 1 2 3 4 5 6 weeks of
31:46
trend consolidation again so we spend far significant more time in the range
31:52
than we doing a trend but the the reason why people get chopped up is because they'll take a trade they'll hold on to
31:58
it thinking that the Market's going to do this next week but they get chopped the [ __ ] up because all the market is
32:04
doing is just it's in a bracketing environment trading the highs trading trading the lows trading the highs
32:10
trading the lows trading the highs chopping everybody who's in the middle really the best opportunities in
32:15
a Range are at these extremities
32:26
okay this cycle is an absolute disappointment I I disagree I don't think it is a disappointment I think it
32:32
depends on what your expectations were if you're basing your expectations on previous
32:39
Cycles which many people do people talk about the fouryear Bitcoin cycle the four-year old coin cycle
32:46
then you're being very subjective you're basing future
32:53
performance on what's occurred in in in the past and I don't think that's the right way to approach
32:58
markets you have to approach markets objectively look at what the market is telling you look at what it's giving you
33:05
the market doesn't owe you or me or anybody else anything okay the market is the market
33:11
and you just have to respect what it gives you and what you can trade and whether you can execute your strategies
33:16
yes we all want to buy altcoins and and hold them and watch them do 20 30 40 X's but how often does that happen you know
33:25
if you're looking to play those altcoin Cycles then I can understand why why it's been a disappointment for
33:32
many you know what my own spot bags haven't done great they've rally 2 3 4X
33:38
on that say I've probably pissed away 30 40% in terms of gains on on the way down
33:44
because of the the Relentless sell-offs that we've seen on altcoins but ultimately from a trading perspective
33:50
I've been very very happy with the volatility that's been an offer until of late where it's been an absolute [ __ ] show this this last week or two
34:11
PE Jam you say discipline is hard is it really hard or are you just being
34:16
lazy nothing's going to come to you if if you're not going to put effort into this game it's not easy it never is it
34:23
never was going to be easy discipline isn't hard you're just making it difficult for you
34:29
yourself the only one stopping you from being disciplined is yourself that's that's the honest truth there's no two
34:35
ways about it when you come to that realization and you have a system in
34:40
place and a strategy that you're looking to trade discipline will hopefully come as
34:46
a result of that process but if you don't have a process you're not going to have discipline at all it's like think
34:53
of bodybuilding think of going to the gym if you want to be a pro athlete you've youve got to have a routine
34:58
you've got to get up on time on schedule you've got to turn up every day to trading right you've got to eat well you
35:04
got to sleep well you've got a journal your progress why is it any different in
35:10
trading if you're looking to be a top Trader you've got to have a routine you've got to have a system you've got
35:15
to have a balance of your lifestyle I I don't think it's healthy spending 16 18
35:21
hours a day in front of your screen and if you are genuinely ask yourself
35:28
how efficiently are you using your time I've done it I've been there I used to say at the screen 16 17 18 hours a day
35:34
trading away I didn't have any system I didn't have any process um most of my trading was very impulsive it was
35:41
emotional I lost a lot of money I made a lot of money I've blown accounts I've done it all because of the fact that I
35:47
never had a process in in 2017 2018 it wasn't until 2019 well at the end of 2018 where I sat
35:54
down and I actually created a trading manual a trading profile
36:03
process which platform do you use for Footprints I use both Sierra charts and EXO charts because I'm starting to trade
36:10
equities again or SPX just just on the side without really talking about
36:17
it most people are in alss yes I'm in alts like I said I only have um 10% of
36:23
my entire portfolio in altcoins if I'm really honest with you guys I'm
36:29
I'm delta neutral on bitcoin I have 10% of my portfolio in altcoins and the rest
36:34
is Cash I'm 75% in cash if that considering I'm delta neutral on bitcoin
36:40
as well so that's kind of a uh a zero some
36:51
position um I'm just going through the questions um that was called we have to hear it yeah it's just the way it is
37:02
yeah JY I get it you know we we all like to ship post I've really C back on the ship posting these last 12 18 months
37:08
just to focus more on trading um and I think ultimately it's not just
37:16
about discipline though it's discipline is everything discipline is you sitting down creating a trading strategy and
37:22
that's what I want to do honestly this is what I really look forward to do because I I I'm not here comparing
37:28
myself to other paid groups or anything but I just think look I've I've been
37:33
through you know over the years I've been in markets I've been trading I
37:39
believe I've been you know fairly successful and I think I'll I'll go on to become even better I've been in this
37:45
game for nine years and uh I I think my best years are ahead of me I really do
37:50
and I'm at this point in trading where I just feel as though I can just lock myself off from social media
37:57
just consume data and use and and those Twitter accounts that I think add value
38:05
but by no means do they influence my trading decisions you know they'll probably put a good macro Viewpoint
38:11
across which I might be interested in they may be talking about flows on the day that's fine but nothing and nobody
38:19
influences my trading decision apart from myself so one of the things that I want to do is is go through the process
38:26
creating a trading money what that looks like and what I've done is I've been preparing this material for you guys in
38:31
such a way that I don't want you to be overwhelmed by looking at what I'm currently doing now 9 years in I've
38:38
really stripped everything back assuming that I've been trading for 2 3 4 years so I've really taken a more
38:45
of a foundational approach to what a trading system should look like what a journal should look like how you should
38:51
manual how you should plan how you should prep let's talk about the basics of not just price action and charts but
38:58
understanding real time data points okay A a candle on a chart really doesn't tell you much okay what will tell you
39:06
more about realtime data point is we we've seen people talk about Market profile okay Market profile isn't real-
39:14
time data run to some extent Market profile gives you
39:20
context so we'll talk about volume profiles we'll talk about market profiles not that I use it extensively
39:27
but that's one point that I want to touch on where execution comes in is more is more around Footprints trading
39:34
stacked imbalances okay that's what I like to
39:40
look for and then in terms of footprint strategies you've got Delta and wines
39:45
okay you've got
39:50
absorption there's exhaustion as well so we we'll cover all the various facets of
39:58
using Footprints and how I how you can incorporate one or two of these strategies with price action at these
40:04
extreme whether it's double tops likely you would have found that if you look at Price action here at these highs this is
40:12
essentially almost a double top I'm not talking about a double top pattern where it there's a neckline and it breaks down
40:18
I'm just talking about the fact that we've we've tagged this level twice you would have seen aggressive LS piling
40:23
into this they got trapped price puked the other way same here aggressive shorts opening they
40:31
got trapped Delta and wine price goes the either way so there subtlety in like absorption
40:39
exhaustion Delta and wines um type of footprints uh footprint patterns that
40:44
you're going to see like stacked inbalances how to read a footprint chart the VAR tyes of footprint charts so
40:50
we'll cover all the basics on on those sessions I just thought talk about it on stream because it's just going to
40:56
probably confuse a a ton of you who who have who have no basic understanding so we'll cover the basics on the on the
41:02
Core Concepts around there and how all that ties into price
41:10
action all right let's move on um I don't think there's much else really to cover on bitcoin I think the only thing
41:16
that does give me a level of caution again like I said I am being aggressive
41:22
I am looking for Longs just when I look at the weekly macd this does
41:28
get me questioning whether we are in a spot of
41:34
bother this was in March April
41:40
2021 this was in November
41:45
2021 you can see the gradient okay you can ignore this this is all
41:53
just a rangeb environment it wasn't a trend again April
42:01
2022 nothing really happened marked to the top again if you look at this it kind of marked the top
42:07
again just something to be wary of okay just if this starts
42:13
expanding what's going to happen here are we going to get a Divergence and then break down or are we
42:22
going to run the lows and then go back to the highs or is that it are we just
42:27
going to break down into this next level of support honest answer I don't know but
42:34
like I says this this is not really anything actionable it's on a weekly time frame what's going to be actionable
42:41
is what happens here okay that's the key for
42:48
me um what else
43:19
let's look at the uh heat UPS
43:36
um we can see that yeah this this's a decent level on
43:42
again this all lines up for me that that 92 93k key 92 93k level is going to be
43:49
key for me and this is where again in real
43:54
time I look for price to come into this Zone here right let's just
44:00
assume that we've got this low
44:14
here so this is the range that I talked about on on the uh actual charts okay
44:20
just assume that's a range there so the question is are we going to run these laws here and
44:28
here and trade into this Zone here what I'm looking for again when I talk about
44:34
the what where what where why and how is surprised to first of all trade into
44:40
this level secondly are shorts aggressively
44:45
piling into this Zone here are these passive bids absorbing price and if so
44:53
what was the momentum of speed into this level if this can hold with large aggressive
45:00
selling on the tape using Ager or watching the Dom with a footprint can I see a reversal back
45:08
inside this value area of where price has been trading for the last 10 12 days
45:17
is this all just a deviation outside of this local range before price
45:24
gets back inside goes to the higher bound of the range that is a fairly good trade setup forget looking at the price
45:31
on the right hand side just completely ignore the price scale purely from a
45:36
structural perspective if you understand anything about position
45:42
sizing risk to reward then you'll know that you can probably get a three fourr trade here
45:50
because your trigger point is essentially going to be this your stop is at this low the mid of this move is
45:57
here you could effectively choke up a two 1.5 1.52 hour trade potentially 3 to
46:03
four hour trade depending on how good your execution is and where your stop is over here so ignore the price scale [ __ ]
46:11
thinking about percentages or Bitcoin moved 1% FX doesn't even [ __ ] move 1%
46:17
a day and people are making good money because they understand the importance of correct position sizing and risk to
46:24
reward profiles so that's what that's the key emphasis that I want to talk about that look there could be a very
46:30
very good trade setup but the the key to all of this is understanding and being able to read what the [ __ ] price is
46:38
doing here not looking at a Candlestick and you haven't got the slightest ideas as to what's actually happening under
46:43
the hood you need to have an appreciation of what's Happening under the hood then you see acceptance then you'll
46:51
re recognize that there could be trap Traders here this could be a decent long execution
46:57
stop at the lows you want to see these POS shorts that have opened here or
47:03
potentially Longs that have puked their positions after building building building they're offside they start
47:08
adding to this short momentum they've got shaken out price goes up okay if price breaks down
47:16
rejects on the underside or comes back inside and then rejects then you can say right we could run the other low which
47:22
is round about
47:31
I can never seem to grip the chart so that you get the point the the point I was trying to make is that are
47:36
we likely to run the other lows okay if we get rejection and we can't find
47:41
acceptance back inside this range again so just another way of thinking of low time frame execution
47:53
there oh there we go that's fine there we go okay does that make
47:59
sense is that clear yeah I've done it yeah thank
48:06
you I don't really scribble on here very often but hopefully you get the gist so
48:12
just understanding the context of the lower time frames is key for understanding what price is
48:18
doing being able to read price at these lower lower time frames to understand
48:23
what you need to see to get into a trade to give you that conviction to get into that trade okay normally
48:30
what you what I what you'll find with me is generally on the streams just to keep
48:36
it level is is the basics the foundations that look should price
48:42
trade into this level here you're giving yourself a probable
48:49
chance of taking on the trade but you don't really know what happened here you need to have an appreciation of
48:57
what happened here and the context of this range here okay so the these are some of the
49:04
things that I'd like to touch upon in the sessions that we have in the group so looking at Market profile looking at
49:10
potential single prints looking at uh trap Traders and again like I said talking
49:17
about the various footprint strategies that I use myself for trading
49:22
Bitcoin all right let's um go back to what what we were looking
49:33
at so this is on the uh binance usdt pair level of Interest whether we trade
49:41
into that remains to be seen and then we've got the binance spot
49:47
pair again fairly balanced if you look at the
49:53
the asks decent depth all the way up to 110 it's going to take some serious
49:59
effort I feel to trade through 110 and find acceptance above it and equally we've got support all the
50:06
way down to around about that 90 90k level below there it's we'll have to see how the books
50:13
recalibrate but essentially again I I feel as though this whole area between
50:23
89 a 92.5 93 is what might be key before we get a move
50:30
up it may not even run this low it may not even run this low it may just stop short and then we trade into these asks
50:36
here that's what I would love to see as a trade setup I really do hope we get
50:43
this all right okay cool
50:51
so let's have a quick look at salana and then I'm going to wrap up the Stream
50:57
I think for Salon again I feel as
51:02
though and again this is where I'm openly going to put my hands up in the air and say to you guys I could be wrong
51:07
there's every chance I could be wrong on this okay this is not actionable what
51:13
I'm about to say next could the top be in on salana or
51:22
the near term top my honest opinion I think
51:31
yes but what does that mean if I'm saying
51:37
this and now I'm telling you that I'm looking for a long off this
51:42
zone am I being bullish or am I being bearish or is it something
51:48
else what have you ascertained by first of all I'm making this statement
51:56
but yet I'm telling you that I'm looking for long here what have you understood from
52:04
that correct I'm being
52:09
objective well done bro you've nailed it I'm being objective about price yes this
52:18
is a subjective view that this is very subjective right but I'm being objective
52:24
in the sense where I'm looking for more long opportunities here for a reversion play back to this
52:31
level or alternatively if I feel the top could be in on salana and I think we're
52:37
heading lower down I don't have to force this trade I don't have to take this long I could simply say to myself right
52:43
I think there's a shi in context here I don't wish to take this long because the fact that if you look at
52:50
Price across the board okay
52:56
would you or would you not agree that this is significant
53:02
resistance would you not agree in terms of the context the fact that we've we we've traded at the all-time highs and
53:10
we've traded above it and what has price done it's rejected off that level once twice three four times we've had four
53:17
attempts to close Above This weekly level not once have we managed to do
53:23
that so what I said subjectively about could the top be in I think
53:28
yes but what I'm being objective about is could I get a trade setup which allows me to trade this back up into
53:35
this Zone here 240s maybe if I'm lucky I might get 250s right and if this rejects
53:42
do I get the short in down to well looking to trade it back towards 140 not in one trade that's being an objective I
53:50
need to see price rally into 260s 240 260 I need to see price reject I need to
53:57
see Longs piling in at the highs I need to see Bitcoin reject from its highs I
54:02
need to see price start rolling over that's being objective yet I was being
54:07
subjective where I said I think the top could be in because being subjective is a loosely held opinion right let's let's
54:14
assume that salana does reclaim back above
54:21
260 now what whatever I said or whatever statement I made means [ __ ] all I can
54:27
still trade this I could still be in a long trading it higher yet my subjective opinion is wrong but yet I'm making
54:32
money so all that matters is can I identify good trading opportunities that fit my system and that I can look to
54:39
execute trades and if I'm pissing Against the Wind assuming that I'm counter Trend trading which could very
54:46
well be the case here on salana right I'm hoping that we find a level of
54:51
support holding here now the difference in this the reason why I'm looking for Longs is I'm
54:57
not hitting Longs straight away the way I'm looking to put play salana in this instance is that look we've had some
55:04
fairly decent reactions from this level here one 2
55:10
3 now a fourth reaction at this level if it's just
55:18
this and that's all we get I need to see more than this okay yeah it's not a bad
55:23
level to get in at 180s stop at the low but really what I would like to see to
55:30
give me conviction on the idea that we could trade back into that 245 level
55:35
which is around here and resistance up here is all right
55:43
I've got this I've got these I've got this level of lows down
55:48
here if price can trade into this guess
55:53
back above then should shows me acceptance above
55:59
188 then I think it's game one that we probably run to these highs here okay so
56:04
Point number one I don't want to be knife catching any of this [ __ ] because
56:09
I recognize I'm going against the trend Point number two I want to see price
56:14
maybe run this low maybe it runs this low I don't know but I want to see price at least swing fail these lows close
56:22
back above it now I'm interested in thinking about longing with an inv validation the lows here what I then
56:28
want to see assume that I execute the trade I want to see price reclaim this previous one hour range low time frame
56:35
range okay if you drop down onto the 1 hour time frame I want to see this be the deviation I can execute here it
56:43
claims back inside here I can look to start running the trade back to the mid then to the highs and then maybe we get
56:49
over extension at the highs anybody who's shorting this is probably going to get spped out if
56:56
there's no rejection late long start piling in and then you get the reversion back down again okay that's all I'm
57:01
looking to do purely level to level trading being objective looking for the data points that I need to see and then
57:10
reacting accordingly to whether my system allows me to take the
57:16
trade and looking at the overall context of the market whether I can take the trade okay that's what's that's what's
57:23
more important to me not this [ __ ] speculative idea that the Top's not in
57:30
for salana salana is going to go to $500 by the end of the year what does that actually mean is it
57:37
actionable no it's not okay can you confidently right buy salana here and
57:46
call for $500 by the end of the year are you really confident on the
57:51
idea and assume you're wrong all right at which point are you wrong then are you going to buy here and 6 months later
57:58
salana is down here then
58:03
what maybe you're holding Sal from the lows right you you haven't taken profit
58:10
because you're now waiting for a bounce but that bounce never comes what are you going to do about that if if this
58:17
scenario plays out what will you do so just some questions that you need to think about how are you OB are you being
58:23
objective by holding salana and it's breaking down and you still holding and it's breaking down into this sport now
58:28
it's $125 was this be an objective or are you just in this for
58:33
the long term because you think it's going to go to 500 fine then do that no problem but I'm talking purely from a
58:40
trading perspective is recognizing and some of the best ways to approach the market is just asking yourself all right
58:47
if I didn't have a position on this what would I be looking for just assume you have no bias no emotional attachment
58:54
what are you looking for okay okay now I personally sold publicly said it as well
58:59
I cashed out at 275 on the 19th price is sold off I've only had one attempt at
59:05
long and salana I was wrong on that idea this was at round about I think it was 220s the minute that lost the level I'm
59:13
out the trade I'm now looking for this level here for a
59:18
reaction can I get something in here and price continues trading this range
59:24
potentially into a lower a lower high into a lower low that's what I would like to see okay from a trading
59:34
context but what I like what I would like to see isn't necessarily what the market has to do so I'm just going to
59:42
react to whatever zones I feel like in Long and whatever zones I feel like in
59:47
short if I can short this because it could continue going higher
1:00:01
so the whole point of this is I'm trying to make you think objectively as today's session
1:00:06
don't think emotionally just because you think
1:00:14
salana should be at $500 by the end of the year that's that's not the way to treat this game okay it's not the way to
1:00:21
go about it when you look at the um salana
1:00:45
shot you've got a fairly decent node at 185 okay so some fairly decent bids
1:00:52
resting in the book 185s is few dollars off so at this low here now
1:00:59
essentially what I'd be looking for is to see how price hits this level and whether we get a reaction off
1:01:06
that 185 184 183 or whether we just literally [ __ ] through this level and
1:01:11
then we can't get back then we can't get back above 185 so basically that's that's this level
1:01:18
here there okay that's that 185
1:01:27
about there okay that's the key level for me so what I'm looking for is if we
1:01:33
come back down are we going to fill some of this in into that qy support
1:01:38
Zone and then what I'm looking for is give me a low so remember that uh
1:01:43
structure that I covered last week so if you got a low you're looking for a higher low into this support Zone push
1:01:50
away that's my trigger to go long I need to see acceptance back above here if I see rejection and price bouncing between
1:01:56
these two zones here and it breaks down I have to get out if I see price bouncing between these two zones and
1:02:03
then pushing game on then we can talk about going to 210 220s okay that's how
1:02:09
I'm thinking about price so understanding the zones of
1:02:14
where and how and what you need to see and why okay CU this is what's going to
1:02:20
ascertain whether contextually you're going to be right on a trade or you need to go get the [ __ ] out of a
1:02:30
trade yeah at the moment I'm only looking for Longs I just don't like the the risk to reward setup for shorting
1:02:36
this Market I could be wrong there could be some very good short setups but at the end of the day it's not I mean when
1:02:42
you look at this it's not part of my system to short into this Zone here I can't I can't short into that no
1:02:49
chance and equally I I I recognize right that I'm somewhat trading against a the
1:02:55
trend because if you look at the daily uh Trend scanner that's rolling over but we are
1:03:02
coming into a level of demand so again this is why I talk about that trading is all
1:03:08
about reactions being reactive okay not just because we're at a sport zone it's
1:03:13
a good time to bid this or you need to look 16 year old 16y old analysis oh
1:03:19
look price is into a level of demand buyers really you really want to see this level hold you could probably take
1:03:25
a long uh as long as this level holds then price could go
1:03:30
higher anybody can be an an analyst essentially but what I've just given you
1:03:38
on the lower time frames is to think about much more than just looking at a daily chart and calling this a zone that
1:03:45
of course it needs to [ __ ] hold anybody who's a first year Char is can tell you this is a q Zone that needs
1:03:51
to hold but what is it that you need to see what do you to see why where how
1:03:57
those are the questions that that they can't answer because to them it's just a box but
1:04:03
there's so much more to it than that it's about reading the final levels of price action and the flows and what's
1:04:09
happening at the books real time execution what's happening with Bitcoin if Bitcoin is breaking down Salon is
1:04:14
going to roll over as well so but ultimately I I I can't short this
1:04:22
there's no way in the world that I would short This and like I said look I I sold my salana at 275 selling in
1:04:30
here so I don't have any position I have no bias I'm not emotionally biased if sler breaks down it doesn't make a
1:04:36
difference to me if sler rallies and I miss it I couldn't really care less all I'm looking for is is there a good trade
1:04:43
that I can take if I can capture some of this move up here my job's done take my money walk
1:04:50
away wait for the next setup there's no way that I'm buying salana at $0000 and
1:04:56
holding it for the next two years hoping it goes to $500 not for me no thank
1:05:14
you ethereum let's look at
1:05:24
ethereum yeah this doesn't surprise me I I I did
1:05:29
not think that ethereum is going to turn around from this anytime soon I think we
1:05:35
have to go through a phase of something similar to this here cuz if you look at what happened
1:05:40
previously right aggressive sell off just look at
1:05:46
this point of sell off here I want you to pay attention to this level here
1:05:51
okay there's our Range High time frame Range High High Time frame range low
1:05:56
where does price seller from this level here we'll do this in
1:06:11
blue when you run It Forward what did price do at this
1:06:19
point she trading within this range
1:06:28
you can see that right you've you've literally got range low
1:06:34
mid the mid this is the midpoint of this range here range low
1:06:41
midpoint midh range okay give or
1:06:46
take running forward from 8th of August to the 29th
1:06:54
or 30th of September that's six weeks of price action is that right yeah you've got
1:07:00
three weeks here you've got four weeks there that's a good six seven weeks 8th
1:07:05
of October two months later right now price is starting to push
1:07:16
away that took from August all the way through to
1:07:21
November to eventually find initiation andak break out
1:07:29
higher now when you look at the current structure if you look at Price
1:07:35
here we're on the daily this is the key Zone that if we
1:07:40
get under here pop above it reject below it that's going to be your C of concern
1:07:46
there okay especially when you get below this level here 3,000 then it opens the
1:07:53
floodgates for lower down so we push up higher we're below the level Wicked into
1:08:04
2900s it's still choppy but like I said watch for how price reacts off this key
1:08:10
pivotal point
1:08:28
that that invalidation aggressive sell off through it we're now traded at the lows we are
1:08:38
contained within that same trading range as we had in August 2024 all the way
1:08:46
through to November so my question to you
1:08:53
is now that you to the context what are your expectations over the next few
1:09:00
weeks knowing that we just had an extensive selloff like we had in August
1:09:06
are you really expecting this to be an ALT season and just to go all the way
1:09:13
up or is it more probable that after you've come off an
1:09:19
aggressive range into a trend Trend down that we're likely just to oscillate
1:09:24
between this Zone here and then how are you looking to
1:09:30
trade this rotational
1:09:38
environment I don't know how long we're going to be in this range for but all I know is that does this look like a trend
1:09:44
to you in here or is this just really low volatility
1:09:52
low average true range chop your price action on The Daily time
1:09:58
frame and it's it's it's periods like these where I step the [ __ ] out the
1:10:03
market because I've got nothing to do here this isn't my strategy this isn't my environment and part of being a good
1:10:10
Trader is understanding your environment what environment are we in
1:10:16
do you have a strategy to trade this are you a scalper are you a day trader are you more of an intraday Trader or more
1:10:23
of a high time frame swing Trad cre a high time frame being 1 hour 4H hour
1:10:28
daily levels where you look for those inflection points like I do because as as a more of a um as an
1:10:36
individual who looks on one or two good setups a week I can't take a trade on this because there's nothing for
1:10:42
me and even still if you look at the previous week right 3rd of February this
1:10:48
was Monday's low and I believe Monday is high
1:10:58
was this here so if you go back at fortnite we're still in that
1:11:04
previous Monday's range Monday's uh mid February 3rd High
1:11:10
February 3rd low February 3rd mid there's really not a great deal you
1:11:15
can do in here unless you unless you're trading on the 1 hour or you scalp scalping on the 5 minute but even
1:11:22
then all you're looking to do is trade the extremes extremes being this that's your range
1:11:31
formed you've got another reaction Point here swing F of this
1:11:37
but it's not for me I'm I'm not a scalper so but you can see where the
1:11:42
reactions are coming in off even on the lower time frames on the 5 minute chart and this is actually a very good way to
1:11:48
to watch footprint watch the flow um generally the best readers of uh
1:11:55
order flowing Footprints are scalpers that that they ex generally they excel
1:12:00
at reading order flowing Footprints and looking for these quick moves intraday moves for a scalp whether it's 10 20 30
1:12:07
40 ticks whatever it is these are the types of moves that they're looking to get a two three four hour trade off but
1:12:13
the key to all of this in terms of scalping is knowing the zones where you want to do your business all right you
1:12:20
could long this target these highs stop at the lows you're looking for a 2 three
1:12:25
R Trader within here and you're done for the day all right but I just want you to appreciate
1:12:32
context on the higher time frame and truly where we are in the market right now we're not in a trending
1:12:38
environment you've only got to look at the the moving averages on the higher time frame let's just clear the
1:12:45
chart let's go to the weekly what do we have for the first
1:12:52
time we've got this bearish crossover since August that tells me that we are not
1:12:59
going anywhere anytime soon I could be wrong again I just made a statement that I
1:13:06
don't think we're going anywhere anytime soon that's just a subjective opinion am
1:13:11
I being objective about that absolutely not objective is identifying where I
1:13:17
might be able to trade this and right now I don't have anything clear it it looks like [ __ ] to me so until something
1:13:24
structurally changes or I believe that price comes into an area of value or
1:13:29
Fair what I deem to be a a good fair value it's going to be down here that's
1:13:35
the level that I'm looking to trade I'm not looking to trade this I can go weeks without touching this [ __ ] if this comes
1:13:42
into here I'll consider doing business if this rejects off this High
1:13:47
Falls back inside I'll consider doing business back to the low okay two areas that I'm looking to do business until
1:13:54
then I'll set my alerts I'll set my alerts I've got nothing to do I'm not looking to day trade this I'm not
1:14:00
looking to scalp it I'm just looking for those one or two high time frame inflection points and let price come to
1:14:06
me that's where patience and discipline comes into and because there's no setup on here I'll look at something else like
1:14:14
salana maybe I can trade this instead if that sets up okay
1:14:26
let's look at um so eth is a bit concerning if I'm really honest if you look at the
1:14:32
uh the higher time frame on the weekly even on the daily it's it's been in the
1:14:37
downtrend since since this year so I did try to take the long and as always you
1:14:44
know I'm always transparent about where the trade didn't work out I talked about the invalidation being at
1:14:51
3,000 the rejection happened we're under the bands as soon as price traded through here I got stopped out and the
1:14:57
solar is I my my entry was 3,200 and I got stopped out at 3,000
1:15:04
just below so I took a loss but I've managed my loss I'm now looking for reasons to step back into the market
1:15:11
whether that's long whether that's short I don't have anything setting up just
1:15:16
yet so again just I keep banging on on
1:15:22
about the word being objective as a Trader you know don't don't come out with ridiculous price
1:15:28
targets look at look at what the market is giving presenting in front of
1:15:43
you yeah there's not not much I can derive from this I couldn't really care
1:15:48
about what type of candle it is it's more about the context more about the structure here so thinking of structures
1:15:55
like this round of structure are we going to get another round of structure where eventually maybe later in the year
1:16:01
we we get a rally in Q4 so that that's the question I'm asking you it's February now you know I hope I'm wrong
1:16:09
hopefully this is a shorter form of consolidation that can trade higher again but also be be prepared that we
1:16:16
might just be in this environment for slightly longer than we uh than we would like
1:16:42
any questions I'm not going to cover any altcoins because the altcoins are just too volatile um maybe I'll cover xrp I
1:16:50
I've made my intentions clear about xrp um I think
1:16:56
we're yeah it could squeeze higher but anything in here reject I'll
1:17:03
probably look to short it down but I have to see the rejection to get into the
1:17:09
trade that's all the really is to it on xrp for me
1:17:16
anyway so is that clear what did I just say about xrp I didn't say I'm going to
1:17:21
blindly short it if it goes up there I said that with that being the high and the
1:17:28
fact that we've never had if you go back to 20120 uh 2019 2018
1:17:35
I should say we've never had acceptance above 218
1:17:41
2018 right now we're rejecting off that level so for now taking almost the mid
1:17:47
of
1:17:52
this if for whatever reason price does
1:17:59
that either we swing F these highs
1:18:06
here and go back inside I'll probably look to take on the short or
1:18:12
alternatively we we reject here close under here I think that's it we probably
1:18:19
look to to do business on this shoulder here break of the trend line game over
1:18:25
back into this and then yeah we'll see what happens after that so is another one
1:18:39
I I would like to see a rally on this um because we have a breaking Market
1:18:46
structure here there's our shiting Market structure right we've got if I take you on the daily you'll see it here
1:18:57
all right so would you agree this is bullish Market structure because you've got higher low higher low another higher
1:19:05
low another higher low okay so that these are your higher low
1:19:11
points what constitutes a breaking Market structure I've got a question for you guys if price trades below here
1:19:25
is this a Breakin Market structure yes or no is it a breaking Market structure
1:20:01
why is it a breaking Market structure is the next question if it is
1:20:07
yes and why isn't it if it's not
1:20:25
so if this was a breaking Market structure what do you
1:20:31
do if price does this now
1:20:36
what now what's your stance was this a breaking Market structure when the market R is higher
1:20:57
all right let me give you another
1:21:15
example was this a breaking Market
1:21:21
structure you have a high you have a high [Music]
1:21:35
low so this is
1:21:44
where we're back we're back I'm not sure what
1:21:50
happens so is this a breaking Market structure was the question yes it was a
1:21:55
breaking Market structure because you got lower lows and you got lower
1:22:06
Highs but
1:22:14
but do we agree that this is be well not bearish Market structure but do we agree that these are lower lows and lower
1:22:20
highs yes or no what what the and and I remember
1:22:26
talking about this in detail and I was probably one of the few guys that was
1:22:31
remaining bullish whilst people kept banging on about yeah but there's a shift in Market structure there's lower lows and lower highs we're going to go
1:22:38
down to 40K what did I talk about that in a rangeb environment and this is where
1:22:44
context comes in right you have to understand the context of
1:22:51
price context what was the context what is this area
1:22:57
forget Market structure now but is this is this a trend or is this a rangeb
1:23:02
environment when you zoom out the chart what's the context of
1:23:10
this does that look like a trend to you or does that look like a range to
1:23:18
you that's a trend that's a trend that's a trend that's a trend that's a trend
1:23:24
that's a range that's somewh Trend into a range into a trend this is a range that leads to
1:23:31
Trend continuation so is this a trend or a range it's just a range so the key thing
1:23:37
I want you to know and understands is that in a Range band
1:23:44
environment context is King Market structure you can get lower lows you can
1:23:49
get higher highs all right assume we get a break assume the the these these are
1:23:54
all lower lows and we get a breaking structure and now we've got a a a higher low followed by a higher high and then
1:24:02
it's a deviation now what do you see where I'm going with this why context is
1:24:08
very important where you have clean Market structure is in a trending environment
1:24:13
okay when it's a rangeb environment people get so sucked in on on on on
1:24:18
Market structure from a contextual point of view with without realizing what the
1:24:24
actual context is okay we we are in a Range it's always
1:24:31
very [ __ ] choppy in a Range that's why context is important so now when I go back to suie now that you
1:24:38
recognize that these are lower lows I'll go back to the previous example and ask the question again
1:25:04
right the point I make made was that we've had a break of structure here but
1:25:09
this isn't a breaking Market structure as such because what would lead me to
1:25:14
believe it is a breaking Market structure is that we need some form of lower high because what if this was just
1:25:20
a run of these lows it claims back inside and it goes higher that is not a shift shift in Market structure the
1:25:25
trend is still making higher highs higher highs this was a ShakeOut okay if that happens so essentially what we want
1:25:33
to see is for for price to effectively go from this type of
1:25:47
environment into this range we've already broken taking out
1:25:53
taken take out the previous what was higher lows we've taken this what we now
1:26:00
are waiting for is if should price trade into this gets back above rejects on the
1:26:06
underside that's your lower high okay that's the rejection exhaustion of
1:26:13
buyers you want to see aggressive sellers start stepping into the market they hit it back
1:26:18
down long start taking profit again and then you get a low low and so forth okay
1:26:24
so this isn't confirmation of a breaking structure yes it's broken the previous higher low but this bounce up and
1:26:31
rejection will give you the confirmation of a shiting structure all right run it
1:26:39
forward we are still currently in the range right now if if this
1:26:46
is to hold this a support and rally up here then I will be looking to short
1:26:52
that anticipating that if we reject this might be the short however if we find acceptance then
1:27:01
I have to cut the trade and accept I'm going to be wrong because we could go higher
1:27:08
okay is that clear secondly
1:27:27
to be confirmed whether this is range bound or not okay if you look at what happened
1:27:36
previously we had a rally aggress the sell off price somewhat reclaimed the
1:27:44
range run the highs okay so this is more of a um more of a up thrust after
1:27:52
distribution than it breaks down harder okay so are we going to get something similar here or are we likely
1:28:02
to get a a lower high and then break down into
1:28:14
this okay
1:28:27
a range is whatever you define it's up to you what you want to Define as a range it's there's no right or wrong
1:28:32
it's what works best for you but I I can't I can't pull off a
1:28:37
clear range on this uh maybe I can it would probably be something like this this is a range
1:28:43
low this would arguably be the range highs and the reason I say that is
1:28:49
because if you go to the Daily time frame
1:28:55
we're not really getting acceptance Above This level it's shortlived okay you get back above it falls down gets
1:29:01
back above rejection you've probably got this as a clear
1:29:09
range that's about as clean as it can
1:29:14
get with regards to identifying a range so even even then right even
1:29:22
then look at your inflection Points Market retests rallies retests
1:29:29
closes back above retests rally again from 280s to 370s okay breaking down
1:29:36
again so the question I'm asking is sui is one of those where depends on
1:29:44
how the market flows over the next few weeks I
1:29:51
might I I'm not really keen on this I might just look for a long but ideally I
1:29:57
would rather see price trade up into here show me signs
1:30:03
of exhaustion I'll take on the short okay I could be wrong on the short because
1:30:08
price might just rip up take out these highs and then get back inside and then
1:30:13
roll over okay but that's where risk management comes into play and have two attempts at shorting
1:30:20
this and it may not even rally this might be just another lower
1:30:25
high we've had a break of this low here you can see we brought the low we closed
1:30:31
back above it we we've lost the level that's the reason to get out of the
1:30:36
trade look at that the minute price gets back above it can't seem to reclaim this
1:30:42
level after losing it people are scrambling to get out get out of the market whoever's been long in this
1:30:48
they're offside they want to get out of Break Even often you see rejection on the inside sell continuation lower down
1:30:56
Okay so let's just see what happens whether this can somehow rally uh into
1:31:01
March for a low high and if that rejects then I think we we probably will be
1:31:06
going lower down all
1:31:16
right all right folks I'm going to wrap it up there I think that's kind of uh enough of the stream but in all honesty
1:31:23
if you really want to keep it it simple just use the EXO Trend scanner
1:31:29
you'll save yourself a lot of [ __ ] pain don't piss Against the Wind and
1:31:35
right now the tide is going lower down the only time where you really want to
1:31:40
be longing these type of structures is first of all you're longing against
1:31:46
the trend secondly you want to see the bands come in and compress price starts chopping
1:31:53
around builds range okay and then it goes very rarely do you see something
1:32:00
like this and if you do then it's probably news driven or event driven and it's probably going to be shortlived and
1:32:06
die again all right but for now if you just look at the bands on The Daily you
1:32:13
go to the weekly doesn't look like a trending
1:32:18
Market to me I think we could if the market holds this level then I would say
1:32:25
we could be entering a phase of price action being
1:32:32
rotational in here okay some forms of
1:32:38
rotations not to this extent but you get the gice so understand the context be understand the context un uh
1:32:46
think objectively and uh let's see what happens all
1:32:52
right is it still cutting out if it's cutting out it's probably a sign of me to to leave then and call it
1:32:59
a day hello parad good to see you but look I hope that makes sense and um
1:33:06
that's all I can say really is that we'll just have to wait and see
1:33:12
what the market gives ultimately but I do have some level of concerns and again based upon on the
1:33:20
higher time frame just looking at the weekly magc D my rule of thumb is that
1:33:26
whenever this crosses over I've always taken caution about
1:33:32
what comes next and it very rarely lets me
1:33:43
down so just something to bear in mind this has to hold
1:33:51
um and if it does we get a reaction there's a trade setup back to the highs
1:33:56
okay if it doesn't then I guess we're in a spot bother and not goore even lower down and
1:34:05
then that's all there is to
1:34:11
it acceptance for me could you define what acceptance is to you one hour
1:34:16
closes daily close building of a base it's for me acceptance isn't time
1:34:23
base it's how price reacts at a level and then reclaims back inside the
1:34:29
previous um value area high value area low so
1:34:34
again something I'll cover when it comes to market profiles how to find acceptance back inside range um what
1:34:41
that means okay but ultimately look on bitcoin like I've
1:34:48
discussed the three levels that you really want to be marking out is December's High
1:34:56
December's low and then if you go on the weekly
1:35:01
time frame you sorry you've also got this daily demand Zone here right but
1:35:07
that's on the daily if you go to the weekly time frame we have not had a weekly close
1:35:13
above 104 so any price action above that level
1:35:19
and price gets back inside sign of weakness okay and and
1:35:24
equally any price action below the weekly low of 93k because we
1:35:30
haven't had weekly close below 93k so should price trade into this
1:35:35
level and then get us back inside I'd be looking for the reversion trade back to the uh back to the weekly range weekly
1:35:43
candle close high of 104s from 94s to 104s if now if
1:35:50
price finds acceptance below oh this weekly
1:35:56
um level of 93k and we can't get back inside that is a possible CA of concern
1:36:03
the longer we spend under there then the greater the concern and
1:36:08
the probable risk increases to the downside okay that's all there is to it so they're the key 1 two 3 four five
1:36:16
zones that I would Mark out they're the key zones that I'm using as pivotal
1:36:22
points for looking for trade setups that I covered at the start of the stream all right and that's it that's all there is
1:36:29
to it I wish you all the best I hope you have a great week ahead I'm going to be very patient in terms of trading the
1:36:34
market and uh essentially letting the setups come to me I'm not looking to
1:36:40
force any trades I'm just looking to flow with the market in the direction of the market and let the market show
1:36:46
me what's coming next and then to react off that information all right wish you
1:36:52
all a great week ahead and and I'll catch you on next Sunday stream take care guys
1:36:58
bye-bye
