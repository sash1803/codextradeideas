Good evening people. Welcome back to another live stream. It's the 20th of November, 2025. The time is 8:00 p.m.
0:12
UTC. It's good to be back on the streams. It's been a while. My last one was back in October. And uh on that
0:19
stream, we talked about the possible downside risks. Unfortunately, that's uh come to fruition. But before we proceed
0:26
ahead, if you can just give me a quick audio check and that you can see my screen in the chat, please. And we shall
0:32
uh go ahead and continue with today's session. Fascinating day in the market.
0:39
We've seen all the major indices sell off from the S&P, the NASDAQ to the Nicay. Dollar showing a bid. Bitcoin
0:46
obviously rolling over. Bitcoin has been showing relative weakness for many weeks now whilst equities was trading higher.
0:52
uh despite the fact that many um participants of the market thought
0:58
Bitcoin was lagging and it will eventually catch up to equities that was unfortunately not to be the case. I
1:04
remember the last time we saw such a lag was November 2021 when Bitcoin was
1:10
rolling over and equities were trading higher into January 2022 and then eventually uh that kind of signal the
1:17
top of the market top of the uh cycle for that period. All right, great. Audio
1:22
all good, screen resolution good. And uh I'm also being joined by Jonathan who's
1:29
a market analyst at Prime XPTt. I'll I'll be bringing him on the stream very shortly. But as always, a special thank
1:35
you to Prime XPTt for partnering with me for these streams. Anything said in today's video is not financial advice.
1:42
It's just my view of the market. It's for educational purposes. And uh hopefully as I've always done over the
1:47
last several years, I've been streaming since September 2020 just to share my views of the market from a high time
1:53
frame perspective, keeping it very simple, looking at micro structure, macro structure, high time frame levels where
2:00
I wish to do business from a swing perspective. Obviously my own style, I I also trade intraday as well, but that's
2:06
generally something that I cover on my private mentorship or it's not a paid group. It's it's a I I was running a
2:12
mentorship starting in March of 2025. You know, it was primarily charity
2:17
based. Uh and I've I've had a lot of people asking me, "Hey, Exo, are you are you continuing with a mentorship? Are you looking for um you know, are there
2:24
any places available?" The good news is yes, there will be um places or spots opening on that. And I will potentially
2:31
be running that from uh taking on new members from December through to the end
2:38
of Q1. And then that's it. We'll we'll call it a day there. But like I said, um that's not a paid group. It's probably
2:43
going to be in partnership with Pride moving forward. So details of that will be coming out on the next stream. So I
2:50
should be hopefully streaming again in a week's time and um looking to bring on
2:55
um a special guest which I think you all know who that is in due course. We'll keep it keep it as a surprise now. But
3:02
um before we proceed further, if I can just get uh Jonathan, are you there to join us?
3:09
Yeah, I'm here doing a little mic check. Yeah, good stuff. And audience, if you can just confirm that you can all hear
3:15
Jonathan's voice in the uh chat, give us a thumbs up and we'll kick off on
3:20
today's stream. So, whilst I'm just waiting for the the
3:26
chat to confirm that, what do we think? Do we think the top is in or is it just a correction before we see 150k? Let me
3:32
see some comments in the chat. Or where do you think we're going next over the next 3 months, year end? Where do we
3:38
end? Do we think 150 is on the cards before the end of December
3:44
or do we think we're we're eventually heading lower
3:57
correction. Interesting. All right, I'm just going to kick off the stream here. Jonathan, I think they can all hear. Okay. Thank you for joining us. How How
4:04
have you been? How's your day been? Oh, I'm I'm I'm great. Interesting. Definitely interesting. I mean, we
4:10
started with the S&P 500 re recovering quite nicely and then I went to have
4:16
dinner. Amazing. Looked at the charts and I'm like, wait, wait, we teleported straight down to to
4:22
new lows. Yeah. A very, very interesting days in the market and I'm sure we're going to have a lot to talk about here
4:27
today. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. And uh it was really good catching up with you off. You've been in the markets as long as I
4:33
have. What? Nine years now, isn't it? Coming into your 10th year in trading. Um, but what markets do you generally
4:38
specialize in? What's your primary markets? You know, where you generally do the bulk of your trading, let's say.
4:47
Well, so I Yeah, that's right. I' coming up to uh nine 10 years now in the markets and I'm specialized in crypto
4:53
and forex. I I I would say I trade forex more uh than crypto, but my heart is in
4:59
crypto. I mean, once you go into into crypto and you experience bull runes
5:04
like we had in uh 2017, that there's no going back. Like, you can't you can never go back from a market like that.
5:10
So, I'm always going to be trading Bitcoin and and altcoin. Uh but but Forex is uh where I'm trading mostly.
5:17
That's where I'm making uh most of my money. Uh Bitcoin, I'm looking at Bitcoin for more of a high time frame,
5:24
long-term perspective, for more investment type of uh approach. But that's uh I guess that's the two main
5:31
main markets I'm looking at. Yeah, great stuff. Great stuff. So, I guess you're primarily more of a high
5:37
time frame swing trader. Is that correct? As opposed to somebody who trades day-to-day, intraday scalping. I
5:43
I I guess you're looking to trade around the higher time frame levels. Correct me if I'm wrong.
5:48
Yeah. So, I'm I'm predominantly a technical analyst. I would say that's my expertise. Well, I am, you know,
5:54
interested in fundamental analysis. I try to get an idea of the macro landscape, but it's it's not I'm I'm
6:01
more going through the markets, looking at analysts uh notes and things like that and trying to get my view on that,
6:07
but where I spend most of my time is in technical analysis and I do uh I'm I'm a
6:12
swing trader and I'm focused on the uh the primary trend, right? So if you're
6:18
looking at Bitcoin right now, we can definitely say that we are on the weekly creating higher highs and higher lows. So that's the trend that I want to be
6:25
part of. Uh I'm I'm mostly looking at the daily time frame because I think everything below the daily is uh is
6:31
basically noise. You're going to get stopped out a lot. You're going to get uh um a lot of uh choppy movement, but the
6:37
daily is clean. It's easy. It's uh relaxing. So um yeah, that fits well
6:44
with my personality. So that's the uh uh that that's kind of like explains my style. I think what we'll do No, brilliant.
6:50
Thank you for that, Jonathan. I think what we'll do for today's stream uh hopefully we'll try and keep it under 50 minutes and really focus on the core
6:57
technical levels. We are well what we plan to do is kick off with the with the dollar index and we'll also have a look
7:04
at S&P the NASDAQ and the Nicay because I think when I quickly have I've just got I've just got my screen up Jonathan
7:09
and when I have a look at those charts um to me it's it I I do feel as though there is a shift in the overall regime
7:16
or market regime. Um, here we've got a chart of the S&P, right? And and and what I'm starting to question is that
7:24
when you look at the charts here for the first time, just bear with me a second.
7:30
Well, when I look at the charts for the first time, you know, not not just the weekly trend, the weekly trend is fine.
7:35
We've got a level of support here at 6,500s, but it's more so the daily where I'm just starting to
7:43
be under the opinion that we may see more of a a sideways corrective market
7:49
because we've had an extensive rally. We had the Trump tariffs, you know, debacle, the market selling off in
7:54
February, shallow rally in in March before the bigger selloff. Once we reclaimed this key 5500 level,
8:03
uh the market has been on a relentless rally from the lows for the next, you know, for the best part of 6 months.
8:09
But, you know, for the first time, um since the lows of uh May the market
8:18
is starting to show signs of weakness where now it's a question of well, look, you know, what's positioning telling us?
8:25
Is is the market likely to remain uh weak for the next two, three, four weeks
8:31
ahead heading into December? Are we likely to see more of a correction down into this key 65 6400 level before we
8:39
can probably think of a rally later, you know, in December. It remains to be
8:44
seen. And I think it's not just the NASDAQ, it's not just the S&P. When I look at the NASDAQ as well, it's it's
8:50
the same over there. Um, the ENQ is rolling over again. This 2500 level has
8:57
been key for me. But, but not just the NAZA, the Nikai as well. I don't know where it is, but every Thursday over the
9:03
last few weeks, Bitcoin has sold off. And I don't know if people have picked up on that. My good friend Tom Capital
9:08
has highlighted that and he's talked about that on his timeline that, you know, Bitcoin has a tendency to sell off
9:13
if there's weakness and it generally sells off on Thursday. And I'm kind of kicking myself that I didn't take advantage of that today because I've
9:20
caught the caught the other moves down on Bitcoin, but um but not not so much today. I was kind of distracted
9:25
elsewhere. But again, when you look at the Nikai here, it's um you know, we're seeing signs of the market eventually
9:33
going going this extensive rally all the way from the lows in April to current
9:38
day where we're seeing consolidation out between the 1221 bands. And if anybody who's been following me for quite some
9:44
time, I use a variation of the 1221s or the 1225s. Um, obviously the 1221 being
9:51
slightly faster. So there are for me um I wouldn't call it concerns in the market because obviously we've had quite an extensive rally. It's just the
9:58
reality is that there there is likely to be a corrective move down. And I think the one thing that you're probably going to start seeing now is calls for a
10:04
recession or extended bare market. And I think it's it's too early to jump into that type of narrative. And at the end
10:10
of the day, even if it is a bare market, even if it if even if there is, you know, the R word being thrown around,
10:16
all that matters is how are you going to action that when it comes to trading, when you look to buying levels, when you look to invest, when you look to trade
10:23
and at the end of the day, you know, I've I've been down the macro rabbit hole. I did very well using um the
10:29
macroecon 222. Kind of fell off the sideway a little bit in 2023. perhaps became
10:35
overly defensive at the lows, you know, but then again, I shorted it from from all the way from the highs. But you
10:40
learn and I think you've got to find a balance between, you know, what the charts tell you versus kind of the the
10:47
news out there. And the two way to really think about markets is that markets are either going to be event
10:53
driven or structural. And I just get the impression that what we saw on the 10th
10:59
of October with Bitcoin was pretty much event driven. Okay, we had an extensive selloff um big huge liquidation and then
11:08
gradually this whole entire move has been fairly structured. You know, very controlled selling. Um obviously there's
11:14
a you know a reason of more sellers than buyers currently in the market. But at
11:20
the end of the day, I think when you really objectively look at the market and you look at where Bitcoin was in
11:27
March down at 75, it really has been up only into 125. So you know from from
11:33
taking it from 75 to 125s without any real significant correction um this
11:39
really doesn't come as a surprise and I think there's a fractal or a schematic that I've been sharing uh on the
11:45
timeline and in the substack group as well and I've been covering that for the last two three months that I had my
11:50
concerns that look please don't get too carried away you've got to start thinking about risks to the downside
11:56
because looking at this from a range range perspective the fact that we've you know the chart that I shared from
12:02
last year was we were round around about this level and my projected levels were 125s. Now I didn't know that the pro
12:09
that the market was a going to get there or b was going to reject from there but it's always a point of interest but but
12:15
what really gave me reasoning to become defenses was was looking at the order flow and looking at really there's a lot
12:20
of buying effort up at the highs. Some of it was induced by shorts being forced
12:26
to close early, therefore becoming aggressive buyers. But the market found resistance and ever since we we we saw
12:33
the liquidation event occur on uh on the 10th of October. Now, if you go back to
12:39
my last stream, the very last public stream that I did, uh, one of the key
12:44
levels that I I talked about in depth and with logical reasoning was this 116
12:50
level. Because this 1 hour or 4hour candle was the origin of the move down
12:56
for the liquidation event because I remember this 116 being a key zone in terms of the uh composite value area
13:03
low. Um but like I said once we had the liquidation event where did price come
13:09
to it it came back to the origin and that for me is what was capping the market and for that reason I've I've
13:15
been looking to sell the market which I think I've done a very good job of unfortunately I failed to capture this
13:22
last leg down from 98 down to uh current day valuation I've not really caught.
13:28
So, I just want to give a bit of context about what I'm looking at from the high time frame markets and and really when I
13:34
when I'm seeing price action here across all markets. I I don't think there's a need to really rush into into knife
13:40
catching this. You know, as a trader, it's easy to get carried away, but you've got to respect the momentum and you've got to respect the trend. Could
13:47
this be a local bottom? Absolutely it could be. But the one thing I will tell you and from my own experience is that
13:52
when you're trying to knife catch these bottoms, you're going to piss away a lot of money. And by the time price
13:57
eventually bottoms, one or two things are going to happen. You're either going to get a sharp V
14:03
reversal, which is a mean reversion, which for me is the far easier trade to take from a selling perspective because
14:10
if we get a mean reversion to 9798, that for me is a far easier trade to take. Now, I will admit that I have I have had
14:18
a couple of attempts at longing the market, one or two have worked out. You know, short-term, intraday, one or two
14:23
have run me over as well. So pretty much all the effort for not much gain. But
14:28
the the one aspect that I was going to talk about is that you're either going to get a review reversal, but what would be better in terms of price going higher
14:36
is more of a structural bottoming process that takes a good month or two or a good several weeks. Because once
14:43
you build that base, that really gives you something to propel from continuously higher where you get every
14:49
every corrective pullback then is a is a higher low into another higher high versus if this just v V reverts back up.
14:57
I think there's a very good chance that you can you can become a seller of this looking for price to come back down.
15:03
Whether it's a higher low, whether it's a lower low remains to be seen. But I just wanted to quickly give a a TLDDR of
15:09
my thoughts of the markets before uh I bring Jonathan on board. And Jonathan, I'm just going to bring your screen up
15:15
now. Why don't you um take it away from everything that I said, why don't you tell us what you're looking at when it
15:20
comes to the market. Preferably, we'll start off with Bitcoin. If you just want to minimize, first of
15:26
all, sorry. If you just want to minimize your watch list. Yeah, the watch list. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry.
15:31
No. So, first of all, love the love the analysis. I I'm absolutely in in agreement with uh with that. So the the
15:38
first thing I kind of want to bring your attention to is the fact that if you look at the uh the trend that we are in
15:43
uh currently right now on on Bitcoin, I'm looking at the log scale right here. So, for those of you who don't know, uh
15:50
the difference between the arithmetic scale and the log scale is that when you're looking at the higher time frames, it's easier to get a complete
15:56
picture of the uh of the of the trend when you're using log scale because uh the moves are normalized by uh
16:03
percentage moves and not the the dollar value. You can easily demonstrate that by just adding that percentage tool and
16:10
moving it up. And you see that the percentage of this tool never changes, but the dollar amount does. and it's going to be reversed when you're using
16:17
when you deactivate the log scale. And you can see the difference here. So when I'm looking at the higher time frames
16:22
and the longer time frame moves, I want to activate the log scale to get a feeling for the the power of the current
16:28
move. And we can very clearly see here that we had one uh impulse uh I'm not
16:34
trading elit waves, but I'm using the word impulse move because I I I think that kind of makes sense in this move.
16:39
So, we get that first bottoming action right here, kind of break structure here, and then another strong push to the upside. Another strong, but this
16:46
one, you're obviously seeing some uh exhaustion here in the in the uptrend where you're weakening out, bottoming
16:53
out uh or or topping out here in a range, breaking down. But if we look at this from a buying the dip uh
17:01
opportunity, we can see that this move to the downside, 32.82%, 82% 39.93% on
17:07
the second one and now 31.96%. So this dip from the top to where we are
17:13
currently is almost exactly the same um amount in percentage from that top to
17:18
this uh bottom. So what's really the issue here? You know, if you look at
17:24
this from a long-term high time frame perspective, what you want to see for this to really be a confirmed downtrend?
17:30
Obviously, you want to take out these lows or at least come up and and create
17:36
a lower high first and then maybe a double bottom that could perhaps break down. But looking at Bitcoin here from
17:42
the higher time frames and zooming out to to to me it it would be I mean
17:48
honestly stupid of me not to look for buying opportunities here because we are in a bull trend, an uptrend and we're
17:53
hitting a support level. Yes, we have erased, you know, all of 2025 gains. That that sucks. But still, we're at a
18:00
level where if you're bullish on Bitcoin for the next 6 to 12 months, then not
18:06
buying here because of fear of more downside, then you're not really investing, are you? You're just thinking
18:12
uh you're not you're just emotional, right? So, from a technical strictly technical point of view, I'm loving this
18:19
level. Now, if we zoom in, as someone who's trading on the daily time frame,
18:24
I'm never really really going to be catching a a knife because I'm always going to be looking for a daily candle
18:30
to close and give me some kind of confirmation. And I love what you said about a a uh V reversal might just come
18:38
up, hit resistance, and that's going to be a good um selling opportunity. But if we build the base, which if I'm looking
18:46
for a base down here, because I think that if we build the base here and sentiment in the market returns to
18:52
bullish in the next few days or or or week, it might not look like a great
18:59
base on the daily, but that's when I use the 4our. So, if we can see a some type
19:05
of base being built here, maybe first reclaim that level, right? Maybe create a range. We got the range EQ here
19:11
trading a little bit and peaking above the range high. And we get that on the 4 hour. And then maybe we have a multi-
19:18
candle uh reversal pattern which might look like, you know, a a bullish candle
19:23
here and then a big bullish candle engulfing that one as a bullish engulfing. Uh that might might be my
19:30
signal to enter. And then the fact that we're in the the the Fibonacci zone between the 0.618 uh 618 and the 0.786
19:38
what I call the reload zone but it's just it's just a name doesn't matter these are the uh the fib numbers that
19:45
zone is historically in all markets basically all markets you can look it up yourself uh on the higher time frames
19:51
it's a a very good area where you usually have great buying opportunities
19:57
in uh in bull markets so yeah I'm I'm bullish on this even though I'm
20:03
cautiously uh bullish Yeah, it's a fair point. I think for me, as somebody who's been very defensive
20:11
since the highs, I've, like I said, I've been shorting the market consistently. I've had a really good four, five, six
20:17
weeks. I think I tweeted earlier in the week that I think the easy shorts are over now. Obviously, I've missed this
20:23
last leg down. It's fine. I'm not going to catch every move. The main thing is I'm not losing money. But when I look at
20:28
the markets here, uh I think technically give or take, you know, I'm not sure where we're going to find support. And
20:34
my job as a trader is not try to guess where support is going to be. I'm going to let the market show me uh where
20:41
buyers are willing to step in or where, you know, sellers are becoming aggressive because one of the key things
20:47
that I talk about is when you when it comes to trading markets, I'm just going to bring my screen up for a second,
20:52
Jonathan. when it comes to uh trading markets, what you really have to think about is if you have, you know, some key
20:59
level here. Sorry, let me just do that again. If you have some key level, essentially what I'm looking for is that
21:05
look, price often comes down into a zone, okay? And you get a a low time
21:11
frame swing fill. Buyers start piling in, okay? They start lifting the offers. But above higher up, there are some
21:18
stacked passive asks. And these could be your larger players, commercial players who are looking to sell uh at the
21:25
market. Okay? So, they're waiting for their bids to get filled and for all this aggressive buying, lifting up the
21:31
office if they if they can't push price higher, but you know, the larger entities
21:36
at play are absorbing all that aggressive buying. And don't forget, you've also got people who may have
21:42
shorted the bottom, right? So they also are going to become forced buyers because what happens when you open a short and you have to close out your
21:47
position, you're essentially becoming a buyer. But what happens when your stop gets triggered or you get liquidated? Okay, you are becoming a force buyer.
21:54
And so what I'm really looking for is if there is a large aggression of buying but the market can't seem to push any
22:00
higher, then it's very likely that the minute this starts coming down, well, whoever was long from say this level and
22:06
whoever's long from this level, well, he's got his stop there and he's probably got his stop there. Okay? And so that's what gives you that cascading
22:12
effect that when these large passive players who are looking to get their orders filled and just say price only
22:17
trades halfway into this zone and then starts breaking down. What do you think the players in the market the
22:23
participants are going to do who never get their got their orders filled? They're going to chase down, aren't they? So then they place their limit
22:29
orders at the next level. Okay. And therefore any bouncers are just being absorbed by uh passive sellers, the the
22:35
large sellers. And again, when price pushes lower down, what would you do? Just assume you've you've long the market over here. You're now offside.
22:43
You're probably going to be very hesitant to hold that position. So therefore, you're going to close and that adds further selling pressure. And
22:49
that's what I've seen happen during this downtrend where buyers are stepping into the market. Okay? A lot of effort has
22:57
gone into buying buying it hits resistance or local resistance and it just rolls over. And that rolling over
23:02
has pime primarily been fueled by aggressive buyers who are then flipping
23:09
out of their positions or getting liquidated on the move down also combined with the fact that there's a lot of selling in the market as well
23:15
from a swap perspective. And then obviously you got participants who are looking to sell on perpetuals or futures
23:20
as well. So really it has been a sellers market for the last several weeks. Um,
23:27
but having said that, what I'm now looking for, and I think what I'm starting to see signs of is that there's a lot of aggressive selling coming in
23:35
just a short while ago at these lows. And what does that mean is it's where you've got a large number of sellers,
23:40
high volume of selling, but really price couldn't push much further lower down. Price rallies slightly and then it comes
23:46
back down again for a real effort, but it's being absorbed. So that clearly then tells me that there's a level of
23:51
interest here in the market that you know in terms of uh passive bids, they're absorbing all this effort and
23:58
for all that selling in the market, the market can't seem to go lower down. Um if I just bring up Exo charts, actually
24:04
I might just have uh have that over here on this image. Um just to demonstrate to
24:10
what to you what I've been seeing for the last few hours. Um so here is the footprint chart. I'm just going to
24:16
change the tick setting to say let's just go with 1,000. Okay.
24:22
Now, if you look at what I've just said um in terms of price, if if you look at
24:28
the volume that's been transacted. Okay. So, here we go. Here's an example of this.
24:34
So, you've got the VWAP band. You've seen a level of a aggressive buying above the VWAP. But look at how the
24:40
candle closed. Okay? And when you when you look at the delta as well, there's your delta. It's positive, but yet price
24:47
has pushed up, but it's closed red. So, what does that tell you? For all that
24:52
aggression in buying, the market wasn't able to push higher. And what happens
24:57
again subsequently, we see a lot of positive delta in the market. But again, why is this not closing up? Because it's
25:04
been absorbed by sellers, passive sellers in the market who are in control of the move down. Okay? Okay. And so
25:09
what happens then if if you've essentially longed this and you're longing this and the and then look at
25:15
where price closes the next candle it barely trades up and it starts trading lower down. So all this positioning now
25:21
becomes unwound and that's where you get this aggressive selling. It's a combination of positions opening and for
25:27
sellers enter entering the market. Now let's just fast forward ahead. What's
25:33
the point that I'm trying to make? So look you can see that pattern continuing. Buyers are trying to step into the market. Price trades lower
25:39
down. But here's where I'm starting to see a shift. Because if you look at the momentum and if you look at the effort,
25:45
we've had minus 35, 45, 68, 43, 41, 46,
25:50
- 22. That is a lot of selling. Yet for all that selling, why has price only
25:56
traded a few hundred? Okay, the that's the first sign that I look at the market. Even when you look at the delta,
26:03
look at the volume. We've had in terms of the candle, we've had $3.85 billion
26:09
worth of volume. And the delta is heavily red minus 207 of net selling in
26:15
this candle. Okay, 60-minute candles. And the next one, 294. The one after
26:20
that, again, more further negative delta. A lot of aggressive selling yet price is being capped at this level. Why
26:27
are we not breaking down for all this effort? there's no gain. Okay, so this is the very first shift that I'm looking
26:35
to see in the market to think, all right, you know what? I think sellers are starting to become exhausted here. So, is this the slow down in momentum
26:42
that I need to see to start contemplating about thinking about longs for at least a mean reversion back up to
26:48
90K? Because at the end of the day, if this level is to hold, you know, and let's just assume that this isn't the
26:55
low of the day, let's just assume that for whatever reason, price comes back in. Sellers come back in very, very
27:01
heavy. So again, we see large selling at these lows, but price closes back above.
27:06
That for me now is starting to signal a potential shift that the market could
27:11
reverse from this point. But obviously where that idea becomes invalidated and I'm not looking at the market to think,
27:18
okay, I'm going to hit a long now. I'm just trying to identify signs of a shift in momentum. And if you look at the
27:23
delta, it's it's when I just zoom out the charts, you can see just looking at the delta here, sellers have been in
27:31
control all the way down. Red, red, a bit of blue. Okay, kind of mark the top. So again, for all that aggressive
27:37
buying, well, they've got trapped. And what has the market done? Trades back under the VWAP bands.
27:43
trapped buyers who are looking to longer the market here with a combination of shorts being squeezed out and the market
27:48
sells off. But now for all this heavy selling that we're seeing at the lows,
27:53
is this the first signs of seller exhaustion? Remains to be seen. But again, that's kind of one way that I
27:59
look at identifying whether uh I'd be interested in longing the market or whether I'm just waiting for further
28:05
confirmation to see seller exhaustion. So if there is another push down, our sellers able to uh take control and take
28:12
it down into 85s or is that the uh the deviation where we we get a push down,
28:18
price reclaims back above there. That for me is now okay, I'm going to start chipping away, chipping away, pull back,
28:24
another rally, I'll add to my bids, and then look for profit into the mean reversion of of 90k. So that's kind of
28:30
how I look at the markets from an intraday perspective. Sorry to kind of ramble on there, Jonathan. I just wanted to give an insight as to what I'm seeing
28:36
when it comes to the flow and the footprints. Um, but just bringing uh
28:41
back to you yourself as well, I think one of the on the high time frame level, if we just look at your chart, correct
28:48
me if I'm wrong, but what's the moving average that you're you're using here? Uh, and and on the
28:56
Yes. So, I was looking at the 100 EMA. So looking looking at from a statistical
29:02
point of view obviously you know in technical analysis what we're trying to do we're trying to look at uh price
29:08
history and then look at patterns and and and uh not expecting but you know
29:13
viewing the markets as we would view the the weather as a weather forecaster and but there's not a lot of statistics on
29:18
this but this is the 100 EMA and basically what I what I tried to ask myself is do we have any exponential
29:26
moving average or simple moving average as well that kind was the uh last line of defense before
29:34
breaking down completely in in in past bull markets where we you know mark the
29:40
entry of a um uh bare market and and of course we're looking at uh 2017 and 18 I
29:48
mean not really sure if this is u we can use this because we have we've already
29:53
already dropped 70% here but you can see at that level when we when we broke down
29:58
completely Uh we went all the way from uh 6K to man I remember that all the way down to uh
30:05
uh 3K I believe. Yeah, that was painful. Yeah. Yeah, that that was insane. That was
30:11
crazy. I I I thought honestly down here that it was over. It was over. I I honestly thought that Yeah, there's no
30:17
there's not going to be a new high. Bitcoin, crypto, it's over. And then of course you start thinking that and we
30:22
have we have that. But that's uh so that's the 100 EMA. I I like the way we're we're hitting that level right
30:28
now. But does it make sense? I don't know. It's just an interesting observation that I'm uh watching here. I I just want to go back to you looked at
30:35
orderflow and I I must say I think that's incredibly impressive and for those of you watching right now, I think
30:42
uh you want to learn that and I'm definitely I'm going to go into your mentorship and and I'll have you teach
30:47
me that because I think I feel like you know we got we got price. Everyone's watching price and then we have indicators based on price. But volume is
30:55
very underrated because volume is is that second layer that we're not seeing in price. But if you can learn how to
31:01
combine price and volume, you have a significant edge over other market
31:06
participants. So u uh that's definitely something I'm going to be when I'm done with my CM CMT studies. Definitely
31:13
that's that's going to be my next next thing that I dive into a lot. Yeah. For me, volume has has always
31:19
played a large part, but but I think again, order flow isn't some magic formula. It's not going to give you a massive edge. I think orderflow just
31:25
kind of helps you read the micro structure in the market. So, if you want to get really nuanced and and figure out what's actually happening at level as
31:32
opposed to some ICT order block guru wizard who's going to tell you there's a
31:37
liquidity grab under this low, but that when price takes that low, why does it roll over there after? It's uh well
31:43
number one it probably wasn't liquidity grab but number two it's it's really about understanding the flows so and I
31:49
think that's what you know people think orderflow is complex it's not it's just looking at the the volume transacted at
31:54
a given level and there's v various ways you can uh use various u volume metrics
32:00
there's volume fixed range volume profiles there's periodic volume profiles there's session volume profiles there's footprint charts you know you've
32:06
got your VPVR as well so for me it's just a nice way to measure the amount ount of effort in the market at a given
32:13
level. That's what order flow essentially is because what moves the markets when you trade when you execute
32:18
a trade you're adding to that you're adding to that volume for that given session whether it's net positive or net
32:24
negative that that's the delta okay so it's really trying to ascertain um who's
32:30
actually in control of the market here and what are the flows telling you but really where I use orderflow is at those
32:36
key inflection points okay so when price comes into a level going back to my olden days of 2019 2020 trade direct.
32:44
So, here's a demand zone. I I have no idea if it's going to stick or if it's going to give me a reason to go long and
32:50
short. But at the end of the day, what I've tried to do is is is is incorporate orderflow into my uh trading of futures
32:57
markets. Not so much altcoins uh but more futures markets just to give me that slight
33:03
51% understanding of reasoning that okay, I I think I think I
33:10
have more reasoning now to actually execute a trade. And it's not just about trade execution. Sometimes it's it's
33:16
also using it on the inverse of that. Reasonings reasons to get out of the market. If I see aggressive selling in
33:23
the market and I'm long because I took a loss earlier in the week on Bitcoin, I long 94s and I cut my trade at 93.7s.
33:29
Why did I do that? Because I could see that for all the aggressive buying, price wasn't going nowhere. When price
33:36
rolled over with with with with with traders then unwinding their position. So basically longs were were
33:42
were closing out which is fueling the move lower down. That tells me this is really weak. I have to get out the trade. Subsequently price traded down
33:49
into 911. So 90k and then obviously thereafter the rest is history really. So but I do I do
33:55
I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I'm not supposed are you supposed to sharing your screen because you're getting a lot of comments on saying that
34:01
they can't see your screen but I'm not no I was just talking um basically high level from from from my thoughts but I I
34:08
I agree. I think this level is honestly um this probably the first level that I've really been interested in from a
34:15
let's just call it a swing trade perspective. And like I said, I'm not rushing into the market. I think I'm just going to let the market settle. We
34:22
we probably will see an aggressive bounce for a good $2 $3,000 higher.
34:28
That's going to be a combination of longs um chasing but shorts closing out
34:33
as well. So that's what generally drives these short sharp uh V reversals is when
34:39
you know late shorts are piling in or shorts are covering. If anybody's been short from 98 95s you know or even even
34:47
90k or 89 then I'm sure they're going to be looking to take profit. And that kind of add adds fuel to those sharp bounces
34:54
that you normally get in a bare market. Well not not I wouldn't call this a bare market but in a downtrend let's just
34:59
retract from that. You know I I don't classify this as a bare market. I think it's too early to even call it a bare
35:04
market. And by the time a bare market's in, we're probably closer to the lows than than we are to the highs anyway. So, it's just a really um bad way of
35:12
framing markets. What I what I really think about is is price at value, you know, and I think shortterm in terms of
35:19
like I said, I've been selling the market for 6 weeks. I look at the market now and I think yeah, there's a lot of
35:24
fear. There's a lot of fear and sentiment, you know, in terms of the timeline that is the top is in, is that it for this cycle? Is this are we now
35:31
heading into a bare market? And that's fine. You know, people are going to speculate, but at the end of the day, as a trader, uh I'm looking for
35:38
opportunities to trade this market and and the zone that we're we're in now, this this 80s zone is of interest. But
35:46
the key thing that you have to remember, just because I'm interested in this zone doesn't mean I have to do business.
35:51
Sometimes part of being a good trader is recognizing that all right, here's a trade setup that I've got planned, but
35:58
you don't have a reason to take the trade. That is part of being a trader. Just because you've mapped a trade out,
36:05
doesn't mean you have to take it. Because if the conditions aren't aligning and you don't see the reason
36:11
that you need to see to execute the trade, then don't take it. It's as simple as that. Okay? But but the but
36:16
the whole point of what I just said there is that you have to understand your own process. You have to understand your strategy. You have to see the
36:23
conditions of a trade setup that give you reasoning as opposed to, oh, I think we're going
36:28
to bounce here because that's not good enough sometimes. Okay? You've really got to understand your process and
36:34
strategy and have a playbook and and understand where your edge lies in this game if you really want to make it. Um,
36:41
so I think I think yeah, I I think we we've probably both aligned here, Jonathan, that this is a probably in
36:46
here somewhere there's going to be a good level to bid. just don't know where yet in all honesty, but like I've explained,
36:52
I'm just waiting to see signs of seller exhaustion. Maybe we see one more liquidation move down.
36:58
Maybe we go all the way to 75K. I I really couldn't tell you at this point. So, I don't really have any uh I don't
37:03
have a horse in this race, so to speak. Would you but but you know, would you
37:08
Yeah. So, would you be interested in buying at 75? Because that I I have a problem with, you know, you're looking
37:14
at the you're looking at the behavior of the trend, right? you get up move retrace up move retrace up move and then
37:19
what happens if you come down here is that is that is that a retrace that you would be buying or is that you know
37:25
that's yes it's a good level it's very close to invalidation because we're basically going to say okay what if what
37:30
if we just draw a draw a box something like this and then we would say okay this is a good level and then what's
37:37
invalidation well invalidation would be a lower low like break breaking below that one going below this zone but I I I
37:44
also feel like the the best trends are the are the trends where the retraces are, you know, no longer uh than than or
37:53
no further down that maybe, you know, the the 0.786 of of that level because when you go down and you create a double
38:00
bottom, you you create a different structure, right? So, you might you might end up end up in a range or you
38:05
might it's there's going to be much more bullish momentum required to even come
38:11
up and test that high. So, I'm not even sure. I I think I'm I'm more of a buyer here than than I am a a a buyer here. I
38:19
would need much more confirmation and conviction to buy down here because honestly if Bitcoin if Bitcoin drops
38:27
another, you know, 11 12% uh I'm going to be thinking about Bitcoin as
38:34
potentially being a a leading indicator of of of sentiment in the market. And
38:39
then I have to look at the uh the macro regime. Like right now I believe we are in in Goldilocks conditions. We have a
38:45
strong US market. Uh job markets are relatively strong. Uh but there's a lot of you know uh potential of liquidity
38:53
easing in the markets. And there's a lot of signs that something might be breaking where we're going to enter a a
39:00
true bare market. And the closer we get to this level, the closer the the the
39:05
risk and the chance of of a true bare market. Uh so I'm I'm a I'm yeah if we
39:12
had a question you know if is is is this a good good time to be a dollar cost average or or start the dollar cost
39:17
average strategy. I mean if you're bullish on Bitcoin and you're in a bullish market regime it's always a good time to be dollar cost averaging. But if
39:23
you are doing so from a leveltole basis yeah I I honestly think this is uh a
39:29
really good level. Now, no financial advice uh of course, but for me personally, uh this these are the levels
39:36
where I'm uh going in heavy on on on trades like this. So, if I have a swing
39:41
trade, I'm going to be watching this. I'm going to not have a a stop-loss on my position trades or my swing trades,
39:48
but I'm going to look at this as my mental stop. And then I'm basically going to uh going to look at, okay, so
39:53
where can we go? 150 that would kind of be in line with the trend. Uh so even at these levels that's a that's a five R
40:00
trade from a investment point of view. If I'm risking a a sign significant part
40:05
of my portfolio here that I'm willing to risk on Bitcoin longterm five above five R that's to me that's extremely good
40:12
risk-to-reward. So I like this. Yeah. And and I think what what really matters here is is the styles that you
40:19
and I have they vary. You know, for me, I can say the 80s is a good buy, and all
40:25
I'm looking to take it into is is a lower high. Um, and for me, where that lower high is will ascertain my overall
40:33
view of the market. So, I I've explained kind of what I'm looking for. If it's a V reverse up into 80, um, 97s, 98s, 100,
40:41
wherever, wherever resistance is formed, uh, if it's a sharp reversal, then I will be looking to sell that. So I don't
40:47
really view the markets from a point of view where this is bullish or this is bearish. I just think look 6 7 8 weeks
40:54
ago when everybody was bullish at the highs I was very very cautious. Now um sentiment is pretty [ __ ] Let's be
41:00
honest it's flat on its ass and I don't even care because I'm looking at the market think all right where can I find
41:06
a good opportunity to long from because I do believe there's going to be a long in here somewhere. And then equally if
41:13
if the market bounces and finds a resistance I'll then let me thinking all right I'm looking for a good sell opportunity that does not make me
41:19
bullish or bearish. I think where my definition and and if just come back to my screen, here's what I'm looking at in
41:26
all honesty. Um when I look at the market here and when I go to Bitcoin on
41:32
the um high time frame view,
41:38
the first thing that I want to point out and and this is where for the viewers who are watching, this is how I shift
41:44
context. Okay. So, when I go to every time frame to the weekly,
41:50
we've just crossed over on the 1221 EMA. Sorry, bear with me a second. We've just
41:55
crossed over on the 1221 EMA. Now, just because we've crossed over, doesn't mean, all right, it's time to be bearish
42:01
because you have to remember moving averages are just a derivative of price. But what's what's fascinating to me in
42:08
this instance, which we've not seen happen this cycle, is that every time
42:14
price has traded below the 1221, it's been a very
42:19
shallow basing of price just hovering below the 1221 as far back as October
42:25
2023. And then the next time after that, again, what does price do? We start
42:30
trading below the 1221 bands. But the key thing here to really take note of is
42:36
the trajectory of the bands. It's not like they're they're rolling over. They're just trading sideways. Okay,
42:41
this to me and and and I talked about this in detail in 2024. Many um analysts
42:49
assumed that this is it. This is the high in Bitcoin because there's a breaking structure. We've got a high. We've got a a a higher low, but now we
42:56
have a lower high into a lower low. Therefore, this is bearish because there's been a a shift in micro structure. My argument is
43:03
this micro this shift of structure does not really matter in a range. You will absolutely get get this wrong because in
43:11
a range you're going to get periods of lower lows and lower highs and then a higher high into a higher low then it
43:16
shifts back into a lower high into a lower low. That is rangebound trading. Okay. A range is that it spends a large
43:24
amount of time trading from support to resistance, resistance to support. It's that bracketed rotational environment.
43:31
Okay. And that's why when you look at the moving averages in this instance, they weren't at any point rolling over
43:38
significantly. And the second thing that you really have to pay attention to here is that all right, we price is trading
43:44
below the bands. Okay, the 1221 weeklys, but has it really extended away from the
43:50
bands? And there's a concept uh referred to as one-time framing. One time framing
43:56
is basically is what you see in a trending environment where you let's just assume this is any periods, right?
44:01
This could be a 1 hour candle, a 4hour candle, a daily candle, but this is one time framing. And what do you noticed
44:09
with each candle? It's just a clean trend down. Okay? At no point did price ever do this where it
44:17
pushes up and then it pushes down and then it pushes back up and then it pushes down again. That's not one triang. Okay? That's just rotational
44:24
price action. And so when you look at the context here, what do you see? You see that type of price action here.
44:29
Pushes back up, trades back down, pushes back up. That's not a clearly defined trend. And then the same happened again
44:35
in um June 2025. What does price do? It breaks below the bands. Okay, but again,
44:41
we had the one expansive candle down, but was there any real continuation? No, there wasn't. Okay, what does price do?
44:49
It oscillates up, gravitates back down into a rounded retest of the lows. It was essentially a rangebound
44:55
environment. What does price do? It hovers just below the bands. It's not expanding below, is it? This is the the
45:02
key difference that I see from from these three instances to where we are today. So, in this instance where price
45:09
has again, look at the trajec trajectory of the bands and the loss of momentum. Price is slowing down as it did here.
45:16
It's doing the same again. But in this instance, we got one expansion down back fill two expansion. And if you look at
45:23
the current weekly candle that we have, okay, this is another reason why I've not really been looking for spot buying
45:29
opportunities because look at this weekly candle. We've barely backed filled the previous week's candle. This
45:35
is a sign of weakness. And it's the same on the way up. When you see markets pushing up like this um expansion from
45:42
this consolidation here, okay, that's the impulse up. But look at this candle. the next candle it barely backs fill the
45:49
previous week's candle and then price consolidates this week here opens up does it trade significantly lower down
45:55
no it doesn't it continues rallying okay so in these trending environments you have to flow with the market in the
46:01
right direction now when I look at price here this is another reason why I'm not just rushing into long share because we
46:07
are seeing that notion of one-time framing if you go to the daily you can see it very cleanly here lower low
46:15
highs Okay. And again, is any candle coming back up to take out the previous
46:21
day's uh wick or even a final acceptance above it? No, it isn't. Okay. So, until
46:26
that happens, um you know, there's two ways to really trade this. You can trade this aggressively like I probably will
46:32
do or you can wait for the confirmation, which is let price come off its trend, push up, okay, then back down. And what
46:39
do you find? You then find that this momentum is now becoming a trend. uh uh sorry is
46:46
coming out of a trend and developing some form of range. Whether this is
46:51
compression before continuation lower down remains to be seen. Whether this is
46:57
consolidation, okay, before we see a reversion back up remains to be seen.
47:02
But the point is that you're going to piss away less money waiting for this environment to then start framing your
47:09
trades knowing that instead of knife catching this all the way down, you can wait for a shift in environment because
47:15
there will eventually be a pullback. Then you can look for the breakout as a continuation play higher. Okay? But if
47:20
you're trying to swing trade this from here to all to the old to the all-time highs, I think in this condition it's
47:26
it's difficult. But good luck to you if you can pull it off. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I think just from a trading perspective is that I I know
47:33
that after an extensive sell off, one or two things are going to happen. It's either going to be a sharp reversal back
47:38
into the bands, it'll probably come back lower down again, or we get a a slightly deeper sell off, consolidation, and then
47:44
another continuation lower down. Then we build a base, okay, rangebound environment like that, and then we can
47:51
start pushing up again. Or if we break down, then we have to go with that. We're wrong on the idea. So, I just
47:56
really wanted to point those um concepts up. But, but basically going back to what I was talking about, that's the
48:02
first real structural change that I've seen in the market. When you look at the weekly bands, when you look at the 12
48:07
and 21s, when you look at how markets generally sell off, there's an example
48:12
of it. That one time framing, there's barely any pullback on the previous weeks. Straight through the bands. Look
48:18
at that multi-week consolidation. Okay. Same happened again. One week, two week, 3 week through the bands, consolidation.
48:25
Second leg down. That's your first leg down. Consolidation. That's your second leg down. So I feel as though like if we
48:32
are going to consolidate in this range, we're probably going to do something like this. Okay. Or this because look at
48:39
the extension of the sell-off. And we saw that happen here. Again, we will probably see a good few weeks of
48:44
rotational price action. And this is generally where I perform really well looking to trade the range. Okay, these
48:51
are really, really good ranges from previously we saw 75 to 88. That's a
48:56
good 12, 13, 14k range. You can make some really good money on that if you structure your trades correctly and you
49:02
play the extremities really well and flow with the lower time frame directional trends on the lower time
49:07
frames. Okay, but as it stands now, I'm just telling you from experience that this is where you start pissing money
49:12
away. Can it bounce from here? Yes, it could. But is it worth the risk? Take just slow down a little bit is all I'm
49:19
trying to say. So that that's that's the weekly time frame. When I now go back into the daily,
49:24
the daily is also telling me, hey, you need to be careful because this is a fairly strong downtrend. Okay, at no
49:31
point has price ever really traded back above the band since 116. Okay, there was a double uh random retest. Look at
49:37
that sell off caps price. I short. Caps price again. I'm short again. Okay, this is where I've not really got latched
49:44
onto a short from 98. That's fine. Didn't catch the entire move down. That's okay. did catch 125s down to
49:50
116s. Did catch 116s down to 107s, 107s to 98s, and that's it. Now, when I look
49:57
at the the weekly and the daily, just think of these as a regime filter. Why do you want to fight the trend? Why do
50:02
you want to be on the wrong side of the market when the market is telling you that, hey, you know what, there's a big structural shift here. You don't really
50:09
want to be flowing on the wrong side. just just equally how where if you look back in um back out April May time if
50:16
you look at the weekly time frame there this here confirmed don't fade the
50:21
market okay and then when you drop into the daily where I've mar that level well there's that look at the trend okay and
50:29
then you get the consolidation as a rangebound environment if you're looking for shorts then this would have been it
50:34
and then potentially here but obviously the market continued higher because the overall regime of the market on a weekly
50:40
basis at at no point did it ever roll over. The strength is to the upside. So,
50:45
this is where I think, and I'm going to use the word defensive, okay? I'm not going to use the word bearish or be
50:51
cautious. I'm not going to uh doom pulse or doom talk. I think there's going to be good trading opportunities if you're
50:57
a trader. If you're an investor, um then I think it's it's a case of where just
51:04
just just let the dust settle slightly. Let the market find some structure. Let it find some balance. Okay? Because
51:09
right now this is an imbalance in the market. This is where sellers are in control. Buyers are nowhere to be seen.
51:16
Perhaps buying interest comes in lower down. Perhaps it comes around here. But let the market show you where there's a
51:21
level of buying interest to start then structuring a trade and start thinking about positioning. So you have you
51:27
generally have a lot more time than you think. Um and it's the same with Ethereum. I I tried to take a long
51:32
Ethereum at 2900 2900s. For me the 2900s was the key level. Uh I've got stopped
51:38
out of my trade. In fact, I cut it because if you look at this contextually, um, sorry, Jonathan, I'll
51:44
be with be with you in in a minute or two. But when you look at this contextually, if I just delete
51:49
everything on the chart here and remove the trend scanner. Um, from a range perspective, you know, I was very vocal
51:56
with the fact that I've sold Ethereum at 48 49s and I've also been very vocal with the fact that I've been shorting it
52:01
even in the private mentorship that I've been doing. Um to me it's a range until
52:06
it isn't until proven otherwise. The retest of this high and the rejection
52:12
for me was the sign that yeah I I I have no reason to be bullish but I'm cautious
52:17
about the downside because I know historically when the market has sold off where does it go to? It goes back to
52:24
the mean. So I'm I'm I'm at this point I couldn't tell you whether the market is going to get there but what I'm telling
52:29
you is that there's a real risk to the downside here. I don't know what could cause it, but I've got no real reason to
52:35
be bullish until we find acceptance back above here. For that reason is why I sold my Ethereum. For that reason is why
52:42
I shorted. Now, in terms of the next key contextual level here was this here. If
52:48
you look at the market and again there this is kind of hindsight but this is exactly what I've talked about time and
52:53
time again on the timeline before the market broke down on the streams on the substacks that look when you look at
53:00
Ethereum what's been the key inflection point in the market one sell off okay
53:06
two sell off again the market sold off from where look at the expansion down every time the market has rejected from
53:13
this level look at the extension of the candles that's telling you that there's heavy supply coming into the market
53:20
every time from this level. Resistance. Resistance again. But look at where the
53:25
market's selling off from. Resistance again. Okay. Now, the key thing that I iterated was that and and I remember
53:32
covering this in detail on stream that as we saw in 2022, look at the market
53:38
breaking down. And then look at the wicks. Okay, this is where you're going to see a lot of people say, "Fuck bears higher. You've got to buy the dip. bears
53:46
don't have a, you know, bears or whatever, right? And the same happened here. It was the same sentiment. [ __ ]
53:51
bears. This market's going to go higher. We're not breaking down this level. But look at how many times price wicked this
53:57
zone and rejected from 42s. Okay, that 42 level is what was key for me in terms
54:03
of capping price. The minute we traded above it and got back below it, we never found acceptance above that. And for at
54:09
that point, I I specifically say to that, look, I think there's real risk that if we start losing this level,
54:15
we're going to see a move very quickly down to this mid-range. Well, if you understood what I've talked about in in
54:21
terms of the the the concepts of one time framing, look at what we've had. One selloff, back fill, not much.
54:29
Another aggressive selloff, not much of a back fill. Now, we're into this support zone that I initially wanted to
54:35
buy. I did long the market from this structure here. And I think what's going to happen if I was to take a guess, if I
54:42
was to hazard a guess, I think basically um this is just another push lower down
54:47
before we see some form of acceptance back above either this level here or
54:53
show me acceptance or confirmation above this level for a mean reversion trade up into 34s is what I'm thinking. Okay. So,
54:59
it's a case of a range high to this uh lower bounds of the range. You've got
55:05
your mid-range above here. You've got your range quarter. You can see exactly why I'm taking it from one level to the
55:10
next. Okay? Nothing more uh complicated than that. I'm just literally waiting for price to say to me, "All right,
55:16
aggressive sellers are piling in now. They can't push the market lower down. I think there's a reason to go long. I'm
55:22
going to start chipping in, chipping in, chipping in, and the market eventually hits my target or I'm wrong below this
55:28
level and we'll probably start trading this range." So, notice I'm just taking it from one zone to the next. I'm not
55:33
talking about I'm bearish here because the moving averages have rolled over. But yes, you have to understand the
55:39
context because the context here is telling you that you're pissing against the wind if you're trying to long. Okay. The only time you're I'm going to try
55:45
and long is when we get a a real extensive push away from the moving averages or a push away from what could
55:52
potentially be considered as a mean reversion trade. So, let's just assume we get one more candle and the moving
55:58
averages are here. I think there's a good chance that we could revert back up into the bands. Okay, before we get a corrective move again, maybe we build a
56:05
base, maybe we see continuation lower down to be confirmed. I don't know the answer to that. Okay, so I'm just trying
56:10
to share with you my thought process. But going back to the original notion of Bitcoin, um you look at the weekly, you
56:18
look at the daily, uh I I just think that you you don't want to be fighting the trend. let it consolidate, let it
56:25
build some form of uh structure at some key level and then we can really start
56:31
thinking about all right, how can we now start taking trades uh in the market for what is developing in front of us. Okay,
56:38
and you can even drop down onto the 4hour time frame. The set of moving averages that I'm using here is the 1221
56:43
EMA. At what point did the 4 hour 1221 crossover? Okay. So, I kind of traded
56:49
against myself here when I uh took a long from 91. Okay. Was it 91? No, it
56:55
wasn't. Was it I think it was up here. Sorry, it was 94s. Sorry. 94s. Got to
57:00
96. Straight into the bands, rolled over. Okay. I cut the trade. That was it. Once we got below the yearly, caps
57:06
price, look at the continuation in the trend. So, sometimes it's just following the simplest of
57:12
systems. If you got a [ __ ] system, maybe you don't even have a process or a system at all. Use a moving average. use
57:17
to set moving averages. It will keep you on the right side of the market until it's time to shift context. Even on the
57:23
1 hour, there's nothing in here that is suggesting that, you know, I I want to
57:29
aggressively get long just yet because every time we've bounced above, rolled over, sell off, bounce above, roll over,
57:35
sell off. Okay, so we bounce above, roll over. Look how shortlived price is above the bands every time.
57:42
That's telling you that there's weakness in the market. Okay? every single time on the 1 hour, it's very shortlived.
57:48
Now, compare that to an uptrend. Okay? On the uptrend, you're probably going to see the inverse where it's going to be
57:56
very, very shortlived um momentum in terms of selling opportunities. Once again, look at this
58:03
market long spends a very shallow amount of time below the bands. The minute it gets back above, flow with the trend,
58:09
okay? Until you come into high time frame resistance. And that's where those ranges come into play. those high time
58:15
frame levels that look if this is a range then what's the key here despite the fact that I've shown you that the
58:21
trend was bullish okay at this level here where's the shift in context well look at this you've potentially got a
58:29
one okay one two three drives into the
58:35
highs and I and I can confirm this looking at the footprints on the order flow aggressive buying at these highs
58:42
unable to push price significantly higher What does price do? Breaks down. Look at the shift in context. Okay, look
58:49
at the shift in context. Why was this important? Because we're at this key inflection point. So again, when when we
58:55
look at current price action here, I just feel as though we're in no man's land. Okay, I I I can't gauge anything
59:01
from this level. It's just in midair for me. Okay, it's coming into a level of local support, which is this cluster to
59:08
the right, but other than that, um, is this level going to stick? Is it going to hold? As a price action trader, you
59:15
don't know. You can play the probability that it might, but you don't know. But for me personally, I want to incorporate
59:22
the order flow and then I'm waiting for the shifting context on the lower time frame moving averages to say, okay, this
59:27
is now setting up for a mean reversion back into the higher time frame bands and I'll take profit. All right. So that's kind of my logic of reasoning
59:33
here from a purely from a trading perspective, not as an investor, but currently as I as I look at the market,
59:39
I think we do have quite a bit of structure to build and and that isn't
59:45
going to happen overnight unless we get a V reversal, which is then just in my opinion a mean reversion type of
59:50
trading. Okay. So you have to understand the structure of price and understand is this a structural change or is this just
59:56
a mean reversion trade. Okay. Um, yeah, that was great.
1:00:02
No, thank you. Uh, very good. Thank you, Jonathan. Let's move over to Should we shift over
1:00:08
to currencies? Just have a quick word on dollar and euro because I think the dollar is really fascinating where where
1:00:14
it's coming into. And I know you've got a short position running on euro USD, haven't you?
1:00:20
Yeah, let's Yeah, we can definitely take a uh look at that. But before we do that, I just want to quickly just give
1:00:27
give give a minute or two to Ethereum here because I I was looking at this and
1:00:33
I was looking at this from first uh from the arithmetic uh uh
1:00:38
chart and basically looking at this and and seeing like well this is a massive range but adding the log scale kind of
1:00:43
get a feeling for feeling for the range. It it feels like we've been in this massive range since since the end of 20
1:00:50
excuse me 2021. And from the weekly perspective, this this to me just looks
1:00:55
disgusting. Like honestly, from I I don't really know where the trend is, where the move is or whatever. So this
1:01:01
to me when when you enter that type of of of of uh environment, what I'm
1:01:06
looking at is uh I'm thinking mean reversion. You know, when we look at Bitcoin, I'm thinking trend following. When we look at Ethereum, I'm thinking
1:01:13
okay, mean mean reversion here. So uh what what can be the the the mean price
1:01:18
or this or or the range and what I'm looking at is basically uh this and what
1:01:24
we have is I think I have to remove the uh the log. Okay. So this is on the log
1:01:29
scale. So you see that it's not completely equal but what I'm looking at is this. So we have I think we have this
1:01:34
as a range. I'm looking at this as sort of a deviation between uh range low or
1:01:40
below range low deviation above range high. And then this is a range GQ. If we
1:01:45
reclaim this range EQ, then I'm going to be looking at higher levels, maybe up to range high. But we are below range EQ
1:01:52
right now. So this is definitely sign of weakness. And if we go into the daily and we see failure to reclaim this and
1:02:00
maybe start moving like this, well then it's it's going to be the range lows. So yeah, I'm and and then what does this
1:02:05
tell us about the overall crypto market, you know? So if Ethereum is going to go down to 2240, where's where's Bitcoin
1:02:12
going to be? So, um, and I also like what you talked about with Bitcoin, the you're looking at the momentum of the
1:02:19
current move on the on the weekly, and that momentum is so strong to the downside that you want to be, you know,
1:02:24
you want to be looking at a clear reversal patterns before you go long. Uh, just want to quickly touch upon
1:02:30
that. Uh, you mentioned the dollar. Okay. So, let's switch over to the uh
1:02:35
the Dixie here, the dollar currency index. Um so basically what we have here
1:02:42
on the dollar is uh a massive uptrend that we've had since the
1:02:49
um since the great financial crisis in 2008 8. There's also I can't show it now
1:02:55
but there's a lot of seasonality patterns showing that uh the dollar has uh I think it's around September u
1:03:04
September November or something like that. I think it's a 80% chance of um
1:03:10
the bouncing. So that adds a little bit of of that uh uh confluence to potential
1:03:16
bounce here. But what I'm looking at is a a very big range where eventually I
1:03:23
see the dollar trading. Now this is a huge range. We're talking all the way back from the you know back in the in the 70s. So, uh, we're looking at dollar
1:03:31
to continue potentially trading within this, uh, range and, uh, maybe come down
1:03:36
to hit the, uh, you know, the average price or the mean price of this overall range. But before we do that, I do see a
1:03:44
significant opportunity of seeing dollar strength, especially if we break above
1:03:49
this level. And as you guys know, the dollar currency index, the Dixie is inversely correlated to Euro USD because
1:03:57
EURUSD is about 60% of the basket of currencies. So if we go to uh Eurusd,
1:04:04
you'll see that that long idea will translate into a short idea on Euro. And
1:04:11
here's a pretty good explanation of what I talked about in the beginning when I said I'm a more of a swing trader,
1:04:17
long-term trader. I'm looking for the cyclical moves in the market. So I'm basically looking at the market from the
1:04:23
perspective of u identifying if we are in a range or an uptrend and are we if
1:04:31
we're in a range is that distribution or accumulation and if we're in a trend is
1:04:36
that a bullish trend or bearish trend. So here we have a clear sign of distribution. we break uh the lows of
1:04:43
the distribution range and that we are looking at a you know uh over almost
1:04:49
2,000 pips to the downside. A 17% move to the downside. For those of you who
1:04:54
are not trading the forex market, a 17% move to the downside or 2,000 pip move
1:04:59
to downside is insane. That's absolutely insane. We then see what I would view as
1:05:05
a fairly short um distribution and then we enter a sideways trending market most
1:05:12
likely based on a a shift in the macro regime. We see clear uh dollar strength
1:05:18
through this move into accumulation, strong uptrend. And now I'm viewing this
1:05:24
as a potential distribution. And this of course aligns with the dollar currency
1:05:31
index because if we add this here and we flip the chart of Euro USD, you will see
1:05:39
that it's basically the same chart, right? So, I can't trade uh the Dixie,
1:05:45
but I can trade EURUSD, which is basically uh the same chart, and that's
1:05:51
what I'm uh doing here. So, I'm betting on downside on EURUSD. I'm looking at
1:05:58
I just secured this trade. So, I've been holding this trade for a week now. Just move my stop down below above that high
1:06:06
because if we break that low, I believe we're going to come down to what I believe is range lows. But if we break
1:06:12
above that high, then we probably have a um return to the sentiment that we had a
1:06:20
couple of months ago with everyone being super bullish on everything u you know
1:06:26
the AI and everything. Everyone just bought everything, invested in everything they could. Uh but I think
1:06:31
that's uh might be a pause on that for the next u two 3 months or so before we
1:06:37
go into a full on uh uh bull market. uh again. So that's what I'm looking at
1:06:42
here. And uh also of course trading I'm trading both this on on prime expert both your USD
1:06:49
and uh and uh and the bitcoin as we have uh you can actually trade all markets on
1:06:54
prime expert. So you got the uh you know the uh you got shares you can trade stocks bitcoin crypto spot uh the
1:07:03
futures market and everything. a little I was going to say that's probably one
1:07:08
thing I've uh I've been playing around with Prime. Uh I don't know if I don't know if the viewers know, but I think there's been a lot of interest in
1:07:14
equities trading. Um and just to let the viewers know that you can trade equities on Prime XPTt. Um there's various promo
1:07:21
codes flying around. You can use mine if you want. You don't have to. Nobody's obliged to. But you can get a a
1:07:27
significant um discount on trading fees. But I I I think even off air and even
1:07:33
with my own friends and I've I've said it in streams as well that I think I I would like to venture more into trading
1:07:38
equities in 2026. I think there's a lot of good opportunities there. Um I want to look at the price action there. I I
1:07:44
really like how clean the price action in there is there is on that side in comparison to how you know altcoins are.
1:07:51
And really the more markets that you have at your disposal to trade the more opportunities or the more better
1:07:57
opportunities that you can trade. you're not just forced to trade something like fartcoin or shitcoin or whatever
1:08:03
whatever bloody coin it is that falls flat on its ass every six weeks. Whereas in stocks, you know, when the market's
1:08:08
bullish, when the regime is bullish, when the NASDAQ is going up, when the indices are going up, your Mac 7 are going to perform. You know, Nvidia's
1:08:14
been on a relentless run. It's coming off that top. But the point is that, you know, where do you make the most money?
1:08:20
You make the most money in a trending market where momentum is trending to the upside. Unfortunately, you've all been
1:08:26
in the crypto space for quite some time. And you know, unless you unless you're in the trenches playing around with half
1:08:33
a mill, 1 mil [ __ ] coins that go to 10 20 mil, fair play. You know that there's there that's certainly one way of doing
1:08:39
it. There's nothing wrong with that. But if you're looking for slightly more liquid plays, you know, it's kind of frustrating in the sense where I've
1:08:46
talked about it with Zedcash. I've really enjoyed trading Zcash because one of the momentum to the upside, but two
1:08:52
there's great selling opportunities to short the market because of the liquidity as well and it's a real shame
1:08:58
that the majority all market is just pretty much flat on its ass. I mean I think I saw somebody in the audience
1:09:04
asked me about Salana hero what's your thoughts on Salana? My thoughts are it's well my thoughts were many weeks ago
1:09:10
that it looks [ __ ] It continues to be [ __ ] Um but it's now coming into a level of interest. Why? Because again,
1:09:16
when you when you look at this from a very simplistic point of view, let's just say high time frame levels. Um, let
1:09:22
me get rid of this. Let's go to the weekly. As far as I'm concerned, when I when I when I look at the Salana chart
1:09:28
here, it's it's it's essentially coming into support. We've had the range
1:09:35
highs. Why people were getting bullish here is beyond me. Again, I had my concerns. This is a significant range
1:09:42
high into a significant range low. That's that's that for me now is where
1:09:48
I've been bearish and now again like as per the tweet I said I just don't think the easy shorts are there anymore. We
1:09:54
are coming into a level of demand. Whether we break through this remains to be seen. If Bitcoin is going to go to
1:10:00
82s then I would say there's a good probability that Salana and and I'm
1:10:05
still waiting for this to do this actually. I I think there's a good possibility that Salana might come out
1:10:10
and take out these lows here. Okay, let me just move this slightly lower down. Okay, there's one low. There's another
1:10:17
one. If Salana can take out those lows and Bitcoin trades into 84s,
1:10:22
I think that gives you a very good setup for a mean reversion where back into the mid-range. So, I'm really looking to
1:10:28
take it from if this is the low in low in the market, I'm going to hit the right hand side of the V. Okay, the
1:10:36
right hand side of the market, that's the backside from 125s and I'm looking to take it to 150s, potentially 160s
1:10:42
into this supply zone. Okay, that's all I'm looking to do. And so, if Bitcoin does push lower down
1:10:49
and Ethereum does push lower down for one more leg, then I think there's a good chance that this trade actually sets up. Um, but again, it's one that
1:10:57
I'm watching for whoever asks in the audience. But again, when you look at the higher time frame, you look at the trend scanner,
1:11:03
it's just been one way traffic. There's nothing bullish about this. All right? Until we can build some form of base
1:11:10
just like we did here. Okay? Show me a build of base. Show me that we can trade above the previous low. And show me that
1:11:18
we can start shifting structure in terms of local higher high, higher low, local
1:11:23
higher high. And then we've got a rotation up. Okay. Into the mid of the range. There's a mid, right? Capping
1:11:30
price. Capping price. Okay. Support, support, support breaks down. This is the reversion trade that I'm looking for
1:11:36
from a long perspective. Why would I want to short into this? No reason to. For me, in my opinion, if if you're a
1:11:43
day trader or a scalper, fine. Go ahead. I'm looking for for a rot rotational play because we are now at the extremity
1:11:50
of this range and that if there is a level that has to or is likely to hold, then this has got to be it for me. If we
1:11:56
start trading below this, that's the point where, as I said on stream earlier on, that sometimes you can set up for a
1:12:03
trade. Okay, so like I said, I'm waiting for price to potentially push into this and and I might take the long here, but
1:12:10
if this starts rolling over, I need to get out the trade. I've got no reason to be a part of this trade anymore because
1:12:15
now the possibility is that we may come down and take out 93s. Okay? So, it's not about being, oh, XO, you were
1:12:21
bearish. I'm just telling you objectively that if I'm long the market here and is breaking down, then I have
1:12:27
no reason to be in the trade because I can always get back into the market is if this pushes down, takes out these lows, then comes back up, fine. I'll
1:12:35
step back into the trade. Big deal. Okay, just because it broke it broke down doesn't mean I'm bearish. I'm still
1:12:41
trying to become a buyer, but I need to see uh reasoning or a shift of of
1:12:47
reasoning as to why I want to get long again. Otherwise, I'll probably be looking to long this level here. I'm not
1:12:52
looking to short the move down from 110s into into 92s. Just how as price was
1:12:58
trending up into 240s, 250s, I wasn't looking to long the level. I'm thinking,
1:13:03
right, where can I short this now? Because it's either going to be from this level here or it's going to be from this level here. It was either this high
1:13:09
or this high. Okay, one of these in this zone is my area of interest. Whether
1:13:14
it's here, whether it's here, or whether it's here, I couldn't tell you. But I know what I'm looking for when it comes to the market. Now, equally on the
1:13:20
downside, it's all right. We've got this zone. I don't know if we're going to come down here and re react, whether
1:13:26
we're going to go deeper and then consolidate and then react. But I do know that the level of the area that is
1:13:32
going to get me potentially back into the market for a long, okay, up back up
1:13:37
into 150s, 160s. Maybe it doesn't happen anytime soon. Maybe it takes a good two,
1:13:42
three weeks. But that that's kind of how I'm framing these high time frame trades outside of my uh intraday trading
1:13:49
aspects. Um sorry Jonathan just just whilst we're on the dollar as well I just want to quickly cover the fact that when I look at the dollar here I it is
1:13:56
at a key level. I think this is a massive level. Um if we do start pushing through then obviously one or two comes
1:14:03
into play. Uh you can see in terms of the daily trend and the daily structure we are at resistance at this moment in
1:14:09
time. So this is just something that I would keep an eye on. Uh there's also you've got the VIX to look at.
1:14:15
There's been quite a spike in volatility today. We we're trading up in the 26s. So clearly that's telling you that
1:14:21
there's been quite a shift in the market in terms of positioning, in terms of risk off. Um and again, when you look at
1:14:28
the ES and the NQ, that's quite the sell off today. So do I really want to be knife catching Bitcoin when equities is
1:14:35
falling off a cliff from 67s to 65s in a single in a single day or two? Not really. So I I I'm happy to preserve my
1:14:43
cash, my trading account. I'm not looking to short these levels. I just don't have anything actionable as it
1:14:49
stands at this moment in time. And sometimes as a trader, it's being able to identify the environment as to where
1:14:56
you have an edge. Okay. So I think that's my long ramblings over with.
1:15:01
Jonathan, I don't know if you have much more to add. I think the the the one aspect we were talking about was Prime
1:15:07
XPTt and how you can trade CFDs, you can trade FX, you can trade indices now, uh
1:15:12
equity indices um as well. So, it's it's it's it's a really good platform for me where I'm looking to day trade or run up
1:15:19
a small account. It's it's the ideal platform for me as opposed to having to wire across money into a brokerage and
1:15:25
get setup and all that kind of [ __ ] that you uh have to put up with. Um so, I
1:15:30
don't know if are there any final questions in the chat? Uh we'll we'll we'll stick around for five more minutes. If there's any questions,
1:15:35
please do let me know. For those of you who are sorry, go ahead.
1:15:41
Yeah. So I I would love to cover two questions here. We have uh one asking if the spread is good. So right now we have
1:15:48
uh one one pip spread on your USD which is uh uh amongst the best in the uh
1:15:53
industry. And then we have another question are the overnight fees and rollover on prime uh expensive or have
1:16:00
they cut them? So, we have worked on reducing those. So, I would uh uh definitely say check it out and see the
1:16:06
the new uh numbers on that. And we're also giving away uh all new users that sign up gets uh uh VIP membership for
1:16:14
the first 10 days, which gives you uh 70% off on your trading fees on crypto.
1:16:20
And you're also getting 20% discount bonus. I believe Exo, you have a link for that as well. And the uh there's
1:16:28
actually no commissions and no fees on uh the PX trader platform which is a platform where you're trading CFD. So
1:16:34
that would be uh stocks, commodities, indices, uh forex and that sort of
1:16:39
thing. So the uh and we also have meta 5. So we have all the platforms within the platform. We have meta 5 for those
1:16:45
of you who are trading forex with that one as well. And so and then industry competitive uh fees. So check it out and
1:16:52
uh I would love to hear your uh uh your feedback on that as well. And you know, we're here uh helping you out along the
1:16:59
ways. We are very big with uh educational content, making sure that our traders know how to trade and uh
1:17:05
gets the right information and we try to take care of the trader from sign up to uh till the end. And uh if you're a big
1:17:12
trader, if you're a trader where you have uh uh a a good amount of volume, you are going to get a a personal VIP uh
1:17:21
client manager where you will get specific um uh market updates and
1:17:27
insights from the our research team. So with the R, we're building something really really cool here and and uh I'm
1:17:33
really looking forward to that. I' I've been very impressed with the u
1:17:39
with the developments of Prime over the last few years. They really have come on quite well. Um I think for for those of
1:17:46
um those of you who want to play around with equities, I think it's a great way to get quick exposure to trading equities. Just play around uh and get
1:17:53
exposure to those markets. If you look at what Nvidia has been doing the last few days or today, it's sold off
1:17:59
drastically. And that's why I've got a small account running on Prime just to take advantage of, hey, let me just run
1:18:04
up a 10K account and see how far I can take it. Um, you know, the last time I did that, the last time I ran up a a 10K
1:18:11
account was on um was in November 2022 on Prime where I took a 10K account to 50K in something like 40 days. nothing
1:18:18
degenerate but because we had so so much FX volatility u if if you guys remember
1:18:24
the UK guilt crisis during that period that was in March February March and then obviously prior to that when when
1:18:31
uh when the pound fell to you know uh I think it was in when the pound fell
1:18:38
to one or three as one or two that was a great opportunity that I I longed the market from one's up to one and 10 so
1:18:44
that was a big trade for me as well and yeah I just took them in prime just for the sake of ease really deposit some
1:18:50
stable coins, took some trades and it's it's a really nice platform. I really do like it. I think Prime's coming a lot.
1:18:55
Um and I'll always continue using it for for that reason. Um the one thing I
1:19:01
wanted to also mention is that again um I'm not you know there's been a lot of
1:19:07
DMs. I keep getting flooded with DMs with regards to the mentorship. I just want to clarify once again
1:19:15
that that the mentorship which is basically me running streams now or I will be running streams twice a week. Uh
1:19:21
positions or spots will be opening from next week, next Wednesday. I will be
1:19:26
hosting another stream and I will have more details about if you want to join
1:19:32
the mentorship then you absolutely can do uh it doesn't cost you anything. It's it's it's it's in partnership with Prime
1:19:38
XPTt which I'll explain and that will run from December through to the end of March. You'll you'll have access to all
1:19:44
my mentorship content which I did for the charity members. Okay. We we raised some good money for charity which I still need to donate at the end of the
1:19:51
mentorship. But uh we have really gone into depth about creating a trading manual, trading psychology, um trading
1:19:59
routine and goal setting, risk management, order flow, order flow part two, seg segment two, the technicals,
1:20:05
AMT auction market theory, volume profile market one and parts two, order flow with guest luxury, u AMT trading
1:20:12
with footprints. I've still got to finish this off. I'm going to go into strategy creation this week and then I'm going to go into journaling next week
1:20:18
and that should be an end of the mentorship. But the resources are going to be there. Okay, I didn't charge
1:20:24
anybody. It was purely for charity. It was supposed to be a four-week group. It ended up being 6 months long because I
1:20:30
just thought why not carry carry on for the sake of it. Um the resources obviously
1:20:35
uh I've shared my Exo charts resources here and I've I'm going to be uploading more worksheets here. So, got a uh issue
1:20:43
tracker, trained in mindset tracker, mental development, weekly trading routine, daily trading routine, daily
1:20:48
market focus list, pre-trade checklist, trade sheets, um you can have access to all them, do whatever you want with it.
1:20:54
Maybe open up a paid group and vlog it. I don't care. But, um that's kind of all there. So, if you are interested in in
1:20:59
that and obviously I run uh market reviews generally once a week, but from
1:21:06
December through to January it it will be twice a week. And I generally try to share actionable trade setups and not
1:21:12
only just trade setups but trades that I've taken and I explain the thought process, the logic behind them, the
1:21:17
reasoning behind them as opposed to all here's a here's a here's a rectangle. It was demand zone. So I bought it's it's
1:21:23
far more nuance than that. I cover the order flow, the market profiles. I look at the dom of the ladder and I explain
1:21:29
the reasoning as to why I took the trade, what I looked for, what I saw and then I also cover trades that I got
1:21:34
wrong because as part of trading it's about being a good loser. I'm not going to win every trade. My win rate is 56%.
1:21:40
At this moment in time for Q4, my win rate on my on my intraday account is at 56%. On my slightly higher time frame
1:21:48
count is probably 68%. I've got slightly chopped up these last few days. Taken taken one too many trades, so it's
1:21:54
probably going to be hovering at 65%. Um, and that's the reality. This game is
1:21:59
all about how good of a trader you are. And and part of being a good trader means that how exceptionally well do you
1:22:07
handle your losses and you will lose a lot. And part of being a good trader, if you look at some of the best traders in
1:22:13
the world like Kristen Kulami who took a $5,000 account to $100 million, I think
1:22:20
he said somewhere on his own streams that his win rate is only 25, 26, 27%.
1:22:26
If you share that on Twitter, you're going to get laughed at. Oh, look, you've got a [ __ ] win rate. Win rate doesn't mean anything. It's all about
1:22:32
your expected value behind a trade. So when you start understanding them, the the maths behind trading, the the
1:22:37
probabilistic ways of thinking of trading as a career, you then start changing your mindset to realize and do
1:22:44
you know what, losing is part of the game. It's making sure that your losses are very very small and that your wins
1:22:50
exceed your losses, then you've probably got a a good chance of uh becoming a good trader. But apart
1:22:57
from that, Jonathan, is is is there any final words? Thank you for coming on. I don't know if you have any final words, but I think we should call it a wrap on
1:23:03
this stream. Yeah. No, I I nothing to add. I mean, uh
1:23:09
great uh great uh comments there. Uh really really like what you're saying about the the idea that uh win rate win
1:23:16
rate is not everything. It's the overall structure, the approach to your trading that that matters. Uh I would like to
1:23:22
you know thank you and uh for for inviting me and uh thanking everyone for for watching and uh I do see that you
1:23:30
have a very engaged and active community and uh really really good to be following along here in the in the chat
1:23:36
as well and yeah been a been a pleasure to uh to be here with you guys today.
1:23:41
No, thank you very much and thank you everybody for tuning in. If you could kindly just hit the likes, leave a comment, troll me in the comments if you
1:23:47
want, whatever you want to do, just uh anything really. But uh if you have any questions that I didn't answer, please

leave them in the comment section. I'll try to address those on the next video which is next Wednesday. But apart from
1:23:58
that, God bless, take care and uh good luck with your trading and I wish you all the best. Thank you very much for tuning in everybody. Take care.
