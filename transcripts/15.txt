All right, we should be live. Welcome back everybody. Just give me a quick confirmation that
0:10
you can hear me on the microphone and you can see my screen.
0:16
We shall shortly proceed.
0:22
How is everybody? All good. Feels like an age since I last streamed. The last
0:28
room was I think at the start of July, first few weeks of July.
0:39
And really all that's happened is that we've been within this range, the upper
0:44
bound of the range. Feels good.
0:50
Yeah, good to see some familiar faces. Thank you for tuning in as always. As you know, today's stream is sponsored by
0:55
myself. That's a refreshing change.
1:03
Thanks. I've missed many of you as well. I've been um somewhat busy with the charity mentorship, which was initially
1:08
supposed to be four weeks. Classic XO has extended it all the way
1:13
to 6 months. Not sure how it's happened, but there you go. Bing off more than I can chew. Essie's
1:21
in the house as well. Is he in the house? Essie.
1:32
All right. Excellent. All right. So, first things first, I think um looking at Bitcoin, what's everybody's thoughts?
1:38
Let's uh get some sentiments. Do we think we're
1:44
close to a top on Bitcoin or do we think we're going much higher? Give me some price targets. What are we thinking? Let
1:50
me see some numbers. Top is in 130, 140, 150, 200 by the end of the year
1:57
or are we close to a top? What's the thoughts? Let's start off with some light hearted banter.
2:10
All right, I've got one person saying close to the top. Another one saying we've topped 150, 170, 140, 109,
2:19
140 area. Okay. Interesting.
2:24
Interesting.
2:36
Yeah. I think look in all honesty my view is um throughout my career as a trader I've
2:43
never been ever obsessed with calling a top on Bitcoin.
2:48
I should say I've been fortunate that when I have shorted it just happened to be at the top in hindsight. Okay. I
2:55
think that's one of the key aspects. I don't look at Bitcoin um and and assume that oh yeah look I think we're close to
3:01
a top here. I think for me it's a case of all right we're at high time resistance. We swing fail the highs. I'm
3:07
looking to become a seller. I've had two attempts at shorting Bitcoin from the highs. I've taken profit on both. Okay.
3:13
As opposed to yes. I think the top is in because in all honesty I don't know. I I couldn't tell you and I think it's one
3:19
of those those aspects where unless there's a real shift in macro conditions which clearly there isn't I still think
3:26
you know following my good friend global flows or capital flows and many others who think uh inflation inflationary risk
3:34
is is greater than a recessionary risk. So you know but for me it doesn't really matter too much because I really look to
3:40
play the the market from one level to the next. And the reason I do that is because why? Why do I play the market
3:47
from one level to the next? Because I simply want to find a good way to manage my risk. Now, if you've tuned in for
3:55
investment advice or for me to tell you that Bitcoin is going to go to $253, $400,000,
4:01
I'm sure it will at some point. You're probably better off following Sailor or Plan B. the the main emphasis of these
4:07
streams this year has purely been more from a trading perspective especially for those of you who are looking to
4:13
trade futures. So, you know, that's what I want to push out there. Essentially,
4:19
my view of the market, how I look to trade the markets in a very digestible way without really going to the depths
4:26
of order flow, footprint, market fl profile, the dom, the ladder, because I
4:31
can appreciate many of you don't really have that experience or that knowledge. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong
4:36
with that. There are traders out there who have made a successful living using using something
4:42
like a VWAP with with a set of moving averages and relative volume. All right, so it's it's all about finding your type
4:49
your style of trading is is essentially what matters the most. Now, let's just take it a step back. When I look at the
4:56
Bitcoin chart, I think to myself, all right, from a structural perspective,
5:02
and again, let me just um maybe just bring up a different chart or a clean chart to begin with. When I look at the
5:08
chart here, and one of the key things I've always talked about, in fact, I I I discussed this on last night's um
5:15
private stream with the uh mentorship members in the in the charity mentorship is that when you look at Bitcoin, and
5:21
again, this isn't set in stone, but it's like an early indication for me, and
5:26
that is when you look at the monthly chart, let's always start from the top down. Let's just look at the the candle
5:32
structures, the candle formations and then think about the probabilistic
5:38
scenarios. Okay, what if this happens? What does it mean for price? And else that I always approach markets from an
5:45
if else then. Okay. Now, one of the key things that I've always discussed when
5:51
you look at the uh monthly chart, it's clearly evident that when you have on a monthly time frame, consecutive wigs,
5:58
okay, not just a small wick, but a fairly elongated spike where price finds
6:03
a rejection, whether it's from the upside or from the downside, okay, and it closes back above on a monthly time
6:10
frame. That's the first thing I look for on the chart, okay? Are we seeing aggressive continuation and are we
6:16
seeing momentum stalling? If you look at previous tops and bottoms, okay, or key inflection points, we had one here, we
6:24
had another one here, okay, not so much at the lows, okay, but then again, if you look at the consolidation phase
6:30
where, like I said, throughout 2024, many people assume that the top is in that this is all going to roll over. But
6:36
at the end of the day, the way that I look at it is it was just a corrective phase of the market. We were looking for
6:42
longs. And essentially, if you look at what the wicks, the the structure of the wicks, okay,
6:48
what they're exhibiting is buyers stepping into the market just like they did here. Okay? And then what do we
6:55
find? We find another local top. We had one rejection, a second rejection. What did the market do? Corrected. Then look
7:02
at the lows. Okay? One, two, three monthly wicks. Again, people calling for a top. What happens with price? Price is
7:10
continuation higher. Now this is where I would probably use the word caution.
7:15
Okay, this isn't again trying to iterate that oh I think this
7:21
is over which many people are doing. Practically practically I couldn't give a [ __ ] Okay, whether the top is in or
7:27
not, all that matters to me is what's the next trading opportunity? How can I look at the market objectively? And from
7:34
everything that I've learned over the last seven, eight, nine years, I'm looking to improve year upon year. If I
7:40
if I'm not seeing improvements in my own game, then clearly I'm not working hard at my own game. Okay? And that's not
7:46
just technically, but from a process perspective, from um a journaling perspective, from looking at my mistakes
7:53
in the past and looking at what I've done well. And one of the things that I' I feel I've done well. Okay? And again,
7:59
like I said, it's not a setting stone is that identifying the possibility that
8:04
look, okay, we've had the June monthly candle push into new alltime highs.
8:09
at 123 and it closed at 115s. Again, we've pushed up into 120 just around
8:16
about 124 and we're already below the monthly open. Okay,
8:21
so the question is, is this another rejection before we get a correction?
8:26
And if there is a correction, how are you prepared for that downside scenario?
8:32
Okay, not whether it's a top. Okay, I couldn't care. But the the question is if there is a correction then which
8:37
levels am I looking to buy? All right. So that's something that
8:43
I think is worth taking into consideration. And the key for me is is currently we've got 10 10 or so days
8:51
left of the month. If this closes below say 116 117 you know somewhere around
8:57
there then I think there's a fairly decent chance that okay look in in the following month in September we might
9:04
get another wick up which gets rejected but below here then I think you've got to be open to the possibility that we
9:09
could see a deeper correction down into previous levels. But I think the one key level that stands out for me just purely
9:16
looking at this from a SR perspective is this level here. Okay,
9:21
this one here that 109 108 level is key for me. That's the key level because
9:26
below here essentially brings us back into this range. Now, that's not to say that we have to go all the way back down
9:33
to 78, but you're looking for some form of correction. Taking the mid at some point, but we'll build towards that
9:41
picture slowly. But all I wanted to do was just give you a higher time frame view and just looking at areas where
9:47
there could be points of invalidation where you may want to uh think about
9:52
hedging for downside risk in the market. All right.
10:00
Now, from a levels perspective, going onto the weekly, I think these are some
10:05
of the cleanest levels that I've traded. One of my key projections, again, this isn't about, oh, look, I call this that
10:12
we're going to go to to the all-time highs, okay? It's it's about, okay, from a from a range projection off this key
10:18
mid mid level. We are into these highs. So, if we want to see targets of 130
10:24
140, now let's talk about the upside. Essentially, I would personally, if I'm
10:30
looking for longs and looking for that continuation higher, this is the zone that I'm focusing on right now. just as
10:37
it stands. Okay, I'm not talking about price trading back down into um 108s or
10:45
98s. I'm not even talking about higher prices. All that I care about at this moment in time is from 124s down into
10:54
109s. Okay, that's all I'm bothered about from a trading perspective.
10:59
As for Bitcoin from a spot perspective, I still hold my Bitcoin spot exposure.
11:04
Okay, if I find a reason to hedge, then I will hedge my Bitcoin spot. Okay,
11:09
because I don't wish to sell my spot. Are we all clear? So, when we really
11:15
look at this and when you go back to June
11:21
essentially when we broke out. So, you can see how price has rejected from this level. Okay, we we took out these highs,
11:28
one rejection, a second one, a third, a fourth, and then eventually we get the
11:33
thrust candle up trading higher. This consolidation here, this
11:39
compression is what led the market higher. We took out this high. So this
11:45
10 110 level is is key for me that such that if we trade into here from a high
11:51
time frame perspective, this is certainly one area where I'm looking to do business from a long perspective.
11:58
Okay, I don't mind price slightly wicking below it. But from a risk-to-reward perspective, if this can
12:04
hold, that gives me some sort of level that I can think about from an execution
12:09
point of view. The way that I trade, okay, and I've talked about this for the last two, three years, is that on the
12:16
candlestick chart, I start off on a candlestick chart. I map out my high time frame levels, top down analysis,
12:22
okay? And then I look at market profile and then I look at the order flow in
12:27
terms of footprints, the dom and the ladder purely for execution. I'm looking for those confluences to give me a
12:34
reason to execute the trades. Okay? I want to see signs of absorption or seller exhaustion, high delta, high high
12:42
relative volume, high spikes of volatility where buyers are able to absorb any aggressive selling. Okay, and
12:49
that aggressive selling doesn't necessarily mean it's shorts opening. Okay, aggressive selling can essentially
12:56
mean something as simple as this. Let's talk about a classic example of what that could entail.
13:07
Okay, looking at the chart, let's just go to the daily or even the 4 hour.
13:13
Now, if you think about it, anybody who's potentially positioned into the market today, right? If you're trading
13:20
this market, where are you going to place your stops? Are you going to have your stops at the recent lows?
13:27
Are you going to place your stop at these lows here? Okay. So, the question is if your stops are
13:33
here and some of you may even have further room to to to allow for your
13:39
stops to rest there as well. Okay. But the point is people assume that when the market is
13:45
selling off it's shorts piling in. Not necessarily. Okay. It can be essentially
13:51
longs being forced to close. So once price is offside for these participants
13:56
while their stops are there if they're buyers. What do they do to close out the trade?
14:02
They become a seller. That's what causes the selling pressure to the downside. And then those who have their stops
14:08
here, what happens there? They also then start getting triggered. Okay? So that's what causes that spike in volatility,
14:16
the spike in volume. What you're then looking for, okay? And this is that key level that I keep talking about. This is
14:21
a consolidation that we had from the previous range. Okay? If this was all
14:27
the rangebound price action that we saw before we saw a break above the level retest and rally. This was the
14:34
initiative aspect of price. Okay. So what was the origin for the move to
14:42
all-time highs? It was this zone here, wasn't it? Therefore, okay, from a level
14:49
perspective that I'm interested in in looking for longs, is
14:54
is there enough momentum to to to make these positions puke into this zone
15:00
here? Right. So, I'm looking at 111s to 110.5.
15:07
Potentially, we might get a wick lower down. Okay, we could fill in some of this inefficiency here, but ultimately
15:14
I'm looking for a reaction around this level. Okay, now what's key? just
15:22
because there's a level there. And if there are aggressive market selling
15:28
into this zone, how do you know for certain that this is the zone that's going to hold or whether
15:34
we just absolutely [ __ ] through this level and go straight down into 107s, potentially 105s? Okay, they're the key
15:42
levels that I can see that stand out. How do you know or what can increase the probability that actually you know this
15:48
is a level that is going to give me confluence that I can hit the trade and execute?
15:53
You're not going to get that on a candlestick chart. You're not going to see that. Okay, on a candlestick chart
15:59
because you're essentially trading with one hand behind your back because you don't know whether this level is going
16:06
to or what certain people call oh look price look here here's a concept which I
16:11
think is flawed. price traded this level and it took the liquidity. All right, it took the liquidity and it pushed away.
16:18
If the so-called large player s liquidity, but then price rolls over, then what the [ __ ] happened to this
16:24
liquidity grab that was supposed to be bullish? Why did price [ __ ] through the level? Because what? All of a sudden,
16:30
they took the liquidity and they thought, "Oh, you know what? I've changed my mind. Let me become a seller."
16:36
Resting liquidity is not what moves price, okay? It's market orders.
16:42
aggressive participants lifting the offers, okay? And those late shorts that
16:47
are probably piling in here and those who've been potentially stopped out their position are now looking to get
16:53
back into the market. And anybody who's shorting these lows and gets trapped on high delta with signs of buyer
16:59
absorption that's at limit orders essentially soaking up any aggressive selling.
17:06
That's what's going to stop price from trading lower down such that demand exceeds supply.
17:12
And you will see that on the dome on the ladder, okay? That will give you a confluence that if you're seen a [ __ ]
17:18
ton of aggressive selling at these lows. And if you think about it from an effort point of view, from a momentum point of
17:25
view, from a volume traded at that level, if there's a [ __ ] ton of volume,
17:31
selling volume happening here, but price can't push lower, that's the first sign that hang on a minute, this level could
17:36
potentially hold. and we are now seeing aggressive shorts opening into the level maybe by looking at open interest rising
17:44
with CVD going down. Okay, that's one way you can identify aggressive selling at the level. And so those shorts then
17:50
become trapped and anybody who starts lifting the offers, well, what would you do if you're going to short the lows?
17:55
You're going to puke your position and that's what gives you that fast aggressive move back up again. Just like
18:00
we had here, everything that I've seen from price from a price action
18:06
perspective, this was the key range for me. Okay, the core of the volume was
18:11
here. Every move up has been shorts getting squeezed, late longs piling in,
18:16
and what happens? The exact opposite. Why was it that price could not break out and go even higher? Because there
18:23
wasn't really any buyer intent. There was no initiative price action here. This is all one big trading range. And
18:31
if it looks like a range and it trades like a range, why would you want to become bearish at the extremes of the
18:37
low? And why would you want to become sentimentally? If you look at the sentiment on the timeline,
18:44
everybody's celebrating these highs, but all it took was half a day. Seven days later, we're down at these lows. And you
18:50
can see the flip on the sentiment on the timeline now. People are calling top. Last week, everybody was calling, well,
18:57
not everybody, but there were loud calls for ETH is going to go to 10K, Bitcoin's going to go to 140. So, just look at how
19:03
the sentiment shifts. People's opinions doesn't matter. The market doesn't give a [ __ ] about what I
19:09
think or what you think or what anybody else thinks. Okay? The market will do what it wants to do. Okay? And and
19:15
that's you've got an array of participants. You've got scalpers, you've got day traders, you've got intraday traders, intrae, you've got
19:22
positional traders, you got commercial traders. And it's your commercial traders, your large entities are
19:27
essentially the ones that move price. Not people like you and me with maybe, you know, a few hundred thousand or a
19:33
million dollar uh million dollars worth of positions. Sure, that's going to help, but the big moves are are
19:39
essentially by those commercial entities, okay? They're the ones that really move price. And so,
19:44
you're really looking for signs of all right, is there enough buyer interest at these lows to absorb price if if we
19:51
trade into this level here? Okay. So whether we do, whether we're not, you know, this could of course be the local low in, I'm not sure. I couldn't tell
19:59
you for certain. I don't have a position on Bitcoin from a long perspective. As somebody who's shorted from
20:06
over here and as as somebody who shorted 123s upon this swing fail, okay, I've
20:11
closed out most of my shorts now. I'm now looking for longs because as far as I'm concerned, it's still a rangebound
20:17
environment until until we see significant enough reason of acceptance
20:23
below here, rejection on the underside, and then I can think about, right, okay, we're now going to be trading this range
20:30
here. Okay, that's it. But this does not come into play for as long as this level is respected. And even then, okay, even
20:38
then we could see aggressive selling becoming a swing fail and price
20:43
reclaiming the level, which should hopefully give confirmation of that's actually a safe trigger with a clear
20:49
invalidation. And you're looking for a mean reversion play back to the mid levels around about 117. All right,
20:54
that's what I would be thinking. I'm looking for signs of absorption if we do
20:59
happen to come down and trade into this level over the next day or two. If we don't, that's absolutely fine. The other
21:05
scenario which I I haven't quite planned out yet is all right looking at these lows here, you know, whether we don't
21:15
trade this and whether we push up first because if you look at price on a 1 hour perspective,
21:21
it's actually very clean level uh price action.
21:30
There's one zone. Okay, here's another zone. So that you can see
21:36
the shift in um this entire we've almost retraced
21:41
the entirety of this move from the 2nd of August and then you've got this level
21:46
here. So for me if we get a break below here then I think there's a very good chance
21:52
that we could see this 110 109 level
21:57
come into play. maybe even as far as this origin of this move up, this
22:04
expansion above consolidation and continuation. But essentially, I would want to see price
22:11
find a level of demand at this zone here. Okay? Because look at the uh clean
22:17
confluence that we have from an SR perspective and such that if this was a consolidation before we saw higher
22:23
prices, then all we're essentially getting is a retest of this level, okay? before we can trade it back inside of
22:30
this range. Essentially responsive price action. Okay, range high, range high, range lows, range lows. Okay, until this
22:37
dynamic or environment shifts, can we then talk about this or can we then talk about this? That's all I'm looking to do
22:44
from a trading perspective. Is that clear?
22:51
At this moment in time, I I don't have a clear trade execution. Any questions so far?
23:02
So, TLDDR, I'm looking for essentially one more push lower down as a trade setup. If the trade set setup comes,
23:09
great. I'm in business. Now, one thing you have to remember, okay, you have to be fluid in your thought process.
23:17
just because I'm interested in doing business in this zone here. Okay.
23:24
As price comes into it, it's decision time. If I see price coming into this zone here and trading through it, does
23:30
that mean I'm going to execute the trade blindly? No, I'm not. It's it was a level that I want to
23:37
trade, but I never got a reason to execute the trade. And therefore, if I see price trading through that level,
23:43
I'm potentially avoiding a loss. Now, just because it's trading through the level doesn't mean that I have to now
23:48
short it all the way down or short on the other side of it because for me it's not a setup that I wanted to take. It
23:55
was a level of interest where I want to execute my trade. I need to see a reason to execute my trade. But if price trades
24:01
through that level, then I have no reason to step into the trade until further information.
24:14
Okay, so that's my thoughts. Now, could Bitcoin bounce from me? Yes, it absolutely could. I may not even get my trade set up. That's just the nature of
24:21
the game. I want to trade my strategy. I want to trade my playbook. Okay. Um,
24:26
when I look at price, I I generally look for relative volume spikes into key zones.
24:31
And I'm not really getting that. I'm not really seeing that just yet.
24:38
Okay, look at these high volume spikes in this instance. It's still fairly subdued. So, you know, we could just
24:45
essentially trade this zone here over the next few days. I know we've got some
24:50
news coming out on Friday and other information coming out later this week. So, let's see. Do we get a
24:57
run of uh 114.7 before another leg down? We'll have to wait and see. All right.
25:14
Just give me one second, please.
25:33
All right. Any questions? so far. Does it make sense? And that's why I
25:38
think for me when I look at order flow, it really gives me
25:44
further clarity um as to how price is reacting at that level. Okay.
25:56
Uh can you explain the reasoning behind the shorts that you took? I'd rather not because that's just going down on a
26:01
whole new segment. I'd rather just look forward now in terms of viable trading
26:06
setups. So, let's just go down to the 1 hour chart here. Very simply put, um I think
26:12
in all honesty, when when you look at price action here, this this zone here is key for me because
26:19
again on yesterday's stream, there was something that I pointed out and I'll point it out again for the sake of uh
26:25
viewers on this stream. If you look at this high here and
26:31
let's just take into consideration consideration this zone here where did price retest literally okay at this high
26:40
before we pushed away took out the highs and came back down. Now
26:47
a similar example for me is can anybody remember? Yeah, it was over here, right?
26:54
Very similar structure. Range consolidation. We break out, okay, of this range which was there for a couple
27:01
of months, consolidation, and there's the impulse into new all-time highs. So,
27:06
when you map out how price reacted at this zone,
27:12
okay, this is the consolidation where I wanted to see a reaction from. When you run this forward, what did
27:19
price do? got very close to trading the level there. Okay.
27:26
And then it comes back down, trades through the level under these lows
27:32
and then pushes away. All right. So again, if we do see price, it could
27:38
rally from the current point where it is in the market, could trade higher and then come back down. Okay, for a deeper
27:44
wipe out of these lows here, okay, this low here into this structure here. that to me if again when you look at the
27:50
relative volume in this instance I think this trade this leg played out last year because of the uh
27:58
again carrier trade okay there's a lot of unwinding at that time this was last August look at the spike in volatility
28:05
relative volume huge spike aggressive selling not shorts opening but
28:10
aggressive selling why because any participants who essentially
28:16
were long from here probably would have had their stop under here. That's what induces
28:22
large orders being filled. Okay, not a liquidity grab. Okay, it's large orders being filled because if those large
28:29
orders didn't exist, what do you think would have happened to price? Price would just come keep coming
28:36
through. Whether it's a macro reason, whether it's an underlying news reason, okay, whether it's whatever it is, a
28:41
shift in policy. But why did the market decide to stop here? Is it because oh I
28:46
um I drew this box here. This box has got nothing to really do with it. It's
28:52
participants in the market who are interested in becoming buyers at this level. You
28:59
don't know by looking at a candlestick chart whether this is going to hold or not. But you will get further insights by looking at the flow, looking at the
29:05
delta, looking at the aggressiveness of this selling activity. And if you're seeing a lot of selling happening at
29:11
this level, but price is not really able to break through it, that's your first sign. Then you want to see price
29:18
reacting and pushing away from that level. So you can start stepping in and scaling into your trades. Then you're
29:23
looking for these lows to hold. Then you know you're into a trade. Okay? So again, when you think about this context
29:29
that I've just shared, this to me would be a much clearer setup. Should it play out? Again, it
29:35
doesn't have to, but for me, I would want to see something very similar play out once again, okay? Where price, look
29:41
at this. It comes around, gives you a random retest off the high. Whether we start pushing back up and eventually
29:48
come back down, maybe, just maybe, okay, we've got a thin level of inefficiency
29:54
here, a bunch of single prints, I believe, or thin inefficiency. Maybe we just come down, trade into that 110,
30:00
109, push back up. That for me is the reaction that I want to see. Want to see absorption of aggressive selling. Okay.
30:07
High spike in relative volume. That's going to be the trade setup that I'm looking for. All right. And again, any
30:13
aggressive shorts piling in, well, that will add fuel to an aggressive unwind to the upside.
30:21
Very fast moves back to the upside. Okay.
30:34
Right. Questions. Why would you long and not short? Why would I short into support? It doesn't make any sense.
30:42
Why? I' I've shorted the highs. I've caught the meat of the move down. I scaled out 117 116 115. I did not catch
30:49
this last leg down. My attention has shifted now to looking for longs because we are in a rangebound environment. And
30:56
like I said, is this a trend? It's not a trend. It's just on the grand scheme of things when you look at the higher time
31:02
frame, I can appreciate that. Yeah, you know what? The monthly doesn't look great. I understand that. But at the end
31:08
of the day, we we could be rangebound here for the next 2 3 months. I don't know what's going to happen next.
31:27
So, if I'm going to short, I'm never going to short into a a um a level of support. I mean, why would I?
31:34
You're asking for trouble essentially. How many times can you short into support and get away with it? The
31:41
opportunity was here. The swing fail of this high and then hitting the backside. And essentially, that's essentially what
31:47
I'm looking to do here. I'm not waiting for the confirmation. A lot of people will probably say to you, you know what, you want to wait for price to trade
31:53
these lows here. Um, watch price push back up. That's your confirmation trade.
31:59
I know if the order flow is telling me that there's enough absorption, I can get in much more aggressively
32:04
with a with a respectable stop, whether it's under under this low here or wherever it is. And I can structure the
32:11
trade far more favorable. Instead of looking for a three R, I can probably get a four or two and a half or three or
32:17
four R out of the trades as opposed to waiting for the confirmation. The confirmation for me is a micro structure
32:23
on the order flow on the footprints on the dom and the ladder, not on the candlestick chart. The candlestick chart is just a compass. It just tells me
32:30
zones where I want to do business. And that's something that I've always talked about over the last two or three years.
32:36
I've always talked about, look guys, there's a lot of stuff that there's a lot of things that I actually do behind the scene when it comes to trade
32:41
execution that I probably don't want to cover because it's just going to drag on, okay? There's a lot of concepts to
32:46
learn. It's not difficult, but you do have to spend time learning those concepts and then getting the
32:52
repetitions in via screen time. All right, so let's shift on to the
32:58
market profile here. Um let's look at so I use a chart as a compass but then I
33:04
use market profile as context. Now when you look at this from a market profile perspective
33:13
and just just to gauge how many of you are familiar with market profile the the reason why I'm starting to cover this
33:19
more often because I'm on my streaming desk and the fact that we now have trading view thankfully
33:26
who have uh incorporated TPOS's right so when I look at this let's just start off
33:33
again when I talk about top down. I start off on the higher time frame. So, go to settings, go to the monthly chart.
33:44
And when I look at the monthly profile here, just looking at the previous month,
33:51
you can see that there was a large area of volume between 115 and 120.
34:00
What did price do? We opened at the value area low. We traded above and took out the highs.
34:07
We've come back down and filled in this inefficiency here.
34:12
Okay. I think at the start of August actually, we we filled in a lot of this inefficiency.
34:19
Now, this is a thin area. The question I'm asking is,
34:25
do we trade this zone here? Okay. Or do we find a level of demand at this zone
34:31
here? again very confluent with that 111 to 110 with a very thin area or a low
34:39
volume node okay or LVN in this instance with a TPO this is an area of interest I
34:44
need to see stickiness of price that if we trade into this level I want to see a reaction from here that's just based
34:51
upon the monthly time frame you can see where price is we're at 114s
34:56
if I see and again the value area high and the value area low is still developing veloping right because we're
35:02
in the current month. But if we start seeing price trading below the valley
35:07
area low into this zone here, what I'm looking for essentially is
35:13
a thin tail. Very little time spent at this level
35:20
with acceptance back above the developing value area low for a reversion trade back to wherever the
35:27
value area high is going to be. That's on a monthly basis. So, if there is a selling tail here and I'm seeing signs
35:34
of aggressive selling being absorbed into this thin area of price, that's
35:40
going to be a level of interest for me. If we trade through there, then I'm stepping away from the trade. Okay? I'm
35:47
not looking for a breakout trade lower down.
35:54
Let's go into the weekly time frame. So, the key things that you really want to be noting here from a trading
36:00
perspective, and again, I tweeted about this earlier today as a as a segue onto this stream. Uh, go ahead and look at my
36:07
um timeline. I shared about the the the pre-market or the preession planning
36:12
that I do. One of the key things that I note is I look at the previous monthly value area high, the previous monthly
36:19
high, the previous month point of control. Is it a naked point of control or not? No, it's not. We've traded that
36:25
level. Where's the previous month's value area low? Where do we have some single prints? We we've clearly traded
36:30
those levels here. Okay. Where are the thin areas or the thin pockets where price has not really spent a lot of time
36:37
and and generally, like I said, you want to see stickiness. So again, if I see a thin selling tail, that's certainly an
36:43
area that I want that that I'm interested in doing business in. Okay. from a long perspective looking for that
36:50
mean reversion trade because at the end of the day like I said I'm just treating this as one big range. All right. So
36:56
let's then go into the weekly time frame.
37:02
I'm just trying to keep the concepts very very simple for you guys to digest for you guys and girls I should say. But
37:09
when you look at the weekly profile here what do you see? What's the first thing that stands out to you when you look at
37:14
this? I'll give you 30 seconds to for somebody to give me an answer in the audience.
37:21
What's the first thing that you recognize which with each of these weekly profiles?
37:36
Yeah. Which platforms do I use? I use Trading View. I use Exo Charts. I use Sierra Charts. I've yet to play around
37:42
with ATS or ATS.
37:48
Right, let's talk about the charact characteristics of market profile from a weekly perspective
37:54
and how we can develop some sort of context. The the whole purpose here is
37:59
to develop context. Okay, the candlestick chart is my compass for high time frame levels. Just looking at
38:06
normal candle structure, the way the candles are shaping, the structure of those candles, but the market profile is
38:13
my gateway. you should say into understanding the actual context of price.
38:19
Three things stand out for me here. If you look at the value area highs, look at the con the consecutiveness. One
38:26
here, another one there, then there again and again and again. So notice how
38:32
essentially this zone here has been capping most of the price action that anything
38:38
above this level has been responsive in nature there in the sense that we
38:43
haven't seen initiative price action. What do I mean by initiative price action? large players, large commercials
38:51
are now accepting higher prices that the demand is there to lift prices even
38:56
higher to 130 to 140 to 150. Clearly that's not been the case. Buyers have
39:02
been nowhere to be seen. Instead, sellers have been the dominant factor
39:07
which again leads us into responsive price action. Why? Because we are seeing rejection
39:13
above these value area highs. There's not been any acceptance and any time
39:18
price has trade above traded above this level, we've not really spent a great deal of time above there. Okay, the core
39:24
of the volume here and here and here again. Look at the value area high,
39:30
value area low where price has spent 68% of the time trading in these zones on a
39:38
weekly basis. Okay, what do you then derive from this?
39:43
Well, you have overlapping value. You can create a weekly composite. One one
39:49
two three four five six week a six week composite there. I'm not going to do that now. But again, these are the
39:55
things that I look at. Is there a weekly composite that I can use? We've already
40:01
noted the levels from the monthly time frames where the value area high and value area low and the point of control
40:06
is and essentially which pockets of thinness thin areas or LVNs that I'm
40:12
looking for price to trade into as a possible area that I'm interested in doing business. Now, when you look at
40:18
the downside of this, where is price often reacted from?
40:23
Again, single prints. Okay, thin areas. Isn't that where price has reacted from?
40:28
112s, poor lows. Okay, unfinished auction, which price has literally just taken out
40:34
this week and we've seen some form of reaction here. But should price find acceptance below
40:42
here. Then look at this gap here. We've got this node between
40:47
111s and 110s. Okay. What I want to see if price is going to trade that area
40:55
again into this single print here. This is very important to take note of. I'll
41:00
tell you why. Because again when you look at the subtleties that you don't you don't see this on a candlestick
41:06
chart. But when you look at the previous range consolidation again overlapping value is
41:12
overlapping. So you've got a 1 2 3 4 5 6
41:18
7 7-day composite, right? And I talked about this on the timeline in June that
41:23
above 109 109.5s. If we get acceptance above 10 109.5, we
41:29
should see a push past this poor high past the poor previous all-time high at
41:36
wherever it was 112 and we should start expanding out to new all-time highs. Okay, that's
41:44
essentially what I tweeted. That's what I was looking for expansion or continuation once we get above this once
41:50
we break out of this composite. Now, if you merge the profiles here, you will
41:55
see that composite. And again, this is what I'm doing. I'm trying to build a picture here of areas of context, high
42:01
high time frame inflection points in the market.
42:07
So, merging this with the previous profile.
42:18
That's three weeks of data.
42:24
That's four weeks.
42:29
It's a bit slow on trading view. Five. Okay. Six and seven. We'll just measure the other two.
42:44
We now have a sevenwe composite. We have the highs here. We have the value area
42:51
high. We have the value area low. Okay. What's key here is if I can just
42:59
depict draw this out for you guys. Imagine you've got a range. Okay. Here's your
43:04
rangebound price action. We spent the best part of price, you know, comes up from the lows into new
43:12
highs and trades in here for a good few months, good few weeks. Okay. above the
43:17
level deviation responsive price action late get trapped they puke price unwinds
43:23
to the lows take out the lows and so forth classical rangebound price action okay another fake out which gets trapped
43:30
price goes above the highs now what's key here okay when you see something like this it's took out the previous
43:35
highs isn't this going to start enticing short sellers so short sellers are
43:41
stepping into this thinking oh yeah I'm looking for a potential mean reversion play back to the uh mid-range or you
43:48
know for whatever reason I think the highs are in I think this is it the top's in on Bitcoin you're going to place your stops there aren't you and
43:54
then you get this shallow pullback and how many times have I said when you've got a range high and price trades above it after trading with that range for
44:02
many many weeks we've retested the highs we've retested the lows on any number of occasions and then you get another push
44:09
shallow pull back inside the range people are thinking yep underside short stop at the high or some people might be
44:15
aggressive just above the highs and think yeah this is a deviation you're going to get these shorts resting there
44:20
what does price do often do you see price break out of a
44:26
range like this when you see this type of price action right it's a very aggressive impulsive
44:33
move an initiative move okay participants are now ready to push the
44:40
market higher and buy at higher prices so what do you think has fueled the move higher
44:46
It's a combination of passive bids soaking any aggressive
44:51
selling and then lifting the offers. And just like a stack of dominoes, these are going to roll over. So, whoever had
44:57
their stops here is going to become a forced buyer. And what happens to price,
45:03
you get that fast expansion. And what do you generally find in terms of characteristics of this candle? you will
45:09
find that this is a very thin candle that not much volume has actually traded
45:14
in this zone here. So when you're looking for those breakout trades, you
45:20
will get these single prints that essentially what you're looking for as price pushes away, you're really looking
45:25
for a ledge as to where the single single print might be for price to retest the level and then continue
45:32
higher because you're never going to get the perfect pullback. You're looking for those thin inefficient areas where
45:37
buyers are now having to raise their bid levels because they're thinking, right, I want to get into this market. I don't
45:43
think it's going to pull back and then you see passive limit orders at those
45:48
thin volume nodes at those thin levels where the single prints are retest and then you get the expansion higher. Okay?
45:55
So, when you've understood that concept, when you see these breakouts of a range with high volume, you're never going to
46:02
get the perfect pullback. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. But what you're really trying to think about is all right, where is it? Where is there a
46:09
level of inefficiency? Or if you're an ICT fanboy, this is what's known as a fair value gap. Okay, when you look at
46:15
the structure that we've got here, this was a 7we composite. Price is ready to
46:20
go higher. What happened is we opened above that level. Okay, and I remember
46:28
this very very clearly as we opened above that level. Okay, this is um I
46:33
wish I had the uh daily profile, but never mind. But but but go back and um
46:39
go to the chart and back test this on a daily uh profile. Okay, price breaks out, retest a single prints and then
46:46
just takes off again and goes even higher. Okay, because what you had on the day or on this week was this
46:51
compression here. This is a weekly profile. This compression, it's like a spring. It coils and coils and coils.
46:57
Then you've got to decide all right is this going to push up higher or lower and eventually I think we traded some
47:03
single prints from back there or where wherever it was and eventually the market took a higher. So the point I'm trying to make is here is essentially
47:10
when you look at price, let me get rid of all these drawings here. When you look at price now and we've got
47:19
this previous composite where the value area high
47:25
is where it's coming in at 109. We've got a level of inefficiency here.
47:31
Single prints. Have we traded this zone yet?
47:43
So two levels of confluence that I need to see hold should price trade this one. I want to see this 7w week composite
47:51
value area high hold. I don't mind price testing this level and holding it. But
47:57
if we for whatever reason, right, find acceptance in here and it pushes above
48:03
and then comes back in again, then I think that increases the probability that we're going to revert all the way
48:09
back to the naked point of control and potentially down to 104, that there is
48:14
the downside risk scenario. Okay, if we find a push into the value area high and
48:20
we can't get back above it or we trade momentarily above it, but it comes back down for a second close or acceptance,
48:26
then we're probably going to revert down to that 104 105 level. Okay, that's the
48:32
risk to the downside. But before that, we know that there's a possibility to long the market because
48:38
we've refined our levels. We've made these key reference points. we have a
48:44
7we composite and again when I'm looking for high probability
48:49
uh inflection points well this was it for me the fact that we've got the value area high a 7we composite value area
48:56
high here we've got these single prints here let me extend the line right we've
49:02
got these lows resting at price here this was the ledge you can see where the
49:08
single print was essentially where price reacted from it doesn't get any cleaner
49:14
than that, okay? In terms of precision, you're not going to see this on a candlestick chart. This this granular
49:20
level of information, but for me, this was the level that I wanted to long. Okay.
49:27
Now, when you move across in terms of again, these are weekly profiles. If you
49:33
look at where price is, we're trading 114.3. This is a thin area that we're trading
49:39
into now. So for me resistance again when you look at the previous two weeks value area lows it's over here. So now
49:47
this area for me it is a level of resistance at 114.7
49:52
is where we might see a level of stickiness. Okay. If we can push above there then I think there's a possibility
49:59
of course right that we we go back up and trade into this naked point of
50:05
control that we haven't traded yet. All right, back to the weekly initial balance of the week, I should say. Okay,
50:13
so acceptance above 14.7 makes me believe that we see a rotation back to 17.5s.
50:19
However, if we get rejection from this thin area where price pushes up, I then
50:25
think that there's a good chance that we could get a move down, take out these lows here,
50:31
potentially into this ledge here or these single prints at 110. Okay, that would get me
50:38
interested. Now, on the dome on the ladder, I want to see absorption at these levels. Okay, that's where the dom
50:44
and the ladder comes into play because I want to see how price reacts at that level. If I just increase the tick size
50:50
to a th00and. Okay, you can see the demand that is
50:58
stacked in the books. In fact, let me do to 2,000 ticks.
51:03
Look at the book depth. I don't need a heat map to look at this data.
51:08
Okay, I can see that the asks are somewhat stacked. We've got 126 between 14 114.5
51:16
and 114.7. Isn't that the area that I just covered
51:22
on the market profile where there's a there's an area or a level of a thin zone? Doesn't that make sense now that
51:28
all right, if I'm going to see absorption of aggressive buying, then do
51:33
you know what? For price to trade higher, we need to see aggressive buying
51:38
lift the offers. So anybody who's shorting this down here is is going to puke. But we really need to see two
51:45
things and that is we need to see the offers either being pulled away. Okay. So just assume there the intention is
51:52
there but as price approaches that level is the intent there? Do do those offers
51:58
actually stick and does price trade into them? And should it trade into them? Are we seeing aggressive buyers piling into
52:05
that level and then they give up and then price aggressive sellers who have filled their orders are now hitting the
52:12
bids and taking the market lower down potentially targeting these lows into that volume area. Okay, that is how I
52:18
think about markets. That is how I think about trading. These are the levels that I'm looking at. 114.7.
52:26
Are we going to see a rejection or are we going to see acceptance above the level? If so, then the probability
52:31
increases to 117.5. If not, okay, if we see the market
52:37
absorbing any aggressive buying at these levels here, then we know that there's a decent
52:44
chance we could get a reversion back down. So, when you look at the book depth, you think, all right, there's a
52:50
[ __ ] ton of stacked bids down at these lows. Now, what would fill these bids?
52:55
Would it not be the case where all those stops resting under this low here and the low all the
53:03
way wherever it is? Wherever it is. Okay, let me just increase the uh the time frame of this.
53:23
So, you're seeing these stacked bids. Are these genuine
53:28
or is there going to be enough selling pressure to absolutely just chew through these levels and take price lower down?
53:34
Okay, that's what I'm looking for now. Because when you look at price here across the line, chances are if you've
53:42
long this, come on, let's let's be logical here. If I if I'm longing this, right, chances are I'm going to probably
53:47
place my stops under here because all right, not myself, but I'm just thinking about how other participants are likely
53:54
to place their stops. Others may go for a wider option and say, "All right, I'm going to put my stop here and actually
54:00
build a position." So, if I'm looking for a swing trade, I'm wrong below this level over here. I'm looking to scale
54:06
into positions all around here. This is how a slightly more higher time frame, larger participant may think about price
54:14
if they're looking to build a position. Whereas a trader who's looking to trade it from one level to the next, their
54:19
stop is going to be here. They've executed here. They may be looking to target this level here. Right?
54:25
But the point is all these stacked bids, you want to see signs of absorption that
54:32
if these longs have their stops under here and here, that is what's going to
54:37
cause aggressive selling into that 111 110 zone. Okay, there's 110. There's 111
54:44
all the way to 112. So 112 to 110 is the area that I really want to see
54:51
aggressive selling being absorbed because if this can't hold up price and
54:56
we don't see the uh the bids get replenished lower down at 109's and 108s. Okay, this can change obviously
55:03
day by day, hour, hour by hour, session by session, tick by tick, we might see
55:09
might see some iceberg orders replenish the bid as they get filled. Just because these get chewed through, we might see
55:14
another 50 million appear here as this gets traded into. Then another 50 million gets that gets traded into and
55:21
they keep replenishing the bids. That's a sign of absorption through uh icebergs. Okay, so these are the
55:27
subtleties that I'm looking for such that if price does trade into this level,
55:33
I then have a level of conviction that all right, we've seen a high level of selling volume here. Okay, I'll give you
55:41
a classic example. If you look at
55:51
If you look at this,
55:59
look at all this aggressive selling. We've had 5 million, 6 million, 9 million, 4, 16, 4, 3 positive delta. All
56:08
this negative delta, all this aggressive selling, 24, 21, 25, 23, 5, 6, 14, 16.
56:16
This is very aggressive selling for all this effort and momentum. Why was it
56:21
that price couldn't trade any lower down? Okay, it got absorbed
56:28
in the books. And then look at where we closed. We closed back above. So all these trades
56:33
are trapped. What happens thereafter? We spring back up. Okay, rounded retest of
56:39
that level and price pushes higher. Okay, the rest is history.
56:45
Okay, look at that one final stop room. So, anybody who's got their stops tight in there again, what do you see? You see
56:51
aggressive selling. Understand that this aggressive selling isn't necessarily shorts opening. It could be longs puking
56:59
their positions, other passive players getting filled, and then the market going the other way. So, these are the
57:06
signs that I'm looking for. Heavy aggressive sell delta at the lows to
57:11
give me reasoning to believe that all right, you know what? We could see a reversion. Here's another example. Okay,
57:19
aggressive selling at these lows. What did price do? It trades the other way.
57:25
Okay, the fact that we had so much aggression at these lows, price came back down one
57:32
more time. sellers really try to push them down. But the fact is that we had all this aggressive selling and what did
57:38
price do? It actually went on to make a higher low. This is your sign in the market that when you sometimes get these
57:44
rounded retests that all this aggressive selling has been absorbed. The fact that there's
57:50
more aggressive selling here and we we've made a higher low, that's a sign that okay, start pushing
57:58
away. That's probably the low end for the time being for a rotation back up.
58:03
And when you think of structuring structuring the trade, your execution, you wait for the candle to close on the
58:09
next candle, you're pushing away. You can execute at 113 with the stop at 11 1 11.8
58:15
and you're targeting these highs at 118. That's a very good 3 4hour trade there
58:20
in itself. Okay, a rotation back up 34 done.
58:27
So that's kind of what I'm looking at. Okay. Even on here, you can see where there's a thin area of price action. And
58:34
again, isn't it confluence confluent with this SR level? Okay. Support,
58:40
support, support. Break through it again. Why did we break through? And
58:45
there's very thin volume here because these aggressive stops under here fuel the move lower down. Okay? It's a
58:52
one-way momentum. So this area now that 14.614.7
58:58
is a key area of resistance confluent with the stacked asks that we've really got to get through this level even up to
59:05
115.1 there's about good 250 and this is just on Binance futures that we've got to get through this level because if we
59:11
don't then there's a good chance we could see a a retest of this level and another leg lower down. Okay, that's the
59:17
risk to the downside. But with the downside, then that comes brings about an opportunity to think about, all
59:23
right, you know what? I think I could be in with a trade potentially somewhere here. Okay, we'll refine it as we go
59:30
along or you should refine this as price trades into those key zones. All right.
59:36
So, that was a quick overview of candlestick charts, market profile for
59:41
context using the monthly, the weekly, uh how I look for trade execution using the DOM, the ladder, uh footprints.
59:48
Again, some of this may be information overload, but what I find
59:55
it's given me over the last three, four years is again a level of execution and
1:00:00
conviction in the trade from a trading perspective. Okay, I'm not talking about investing in Bitcoin and buying spot
1:00:07
Bitcoin. That for me is purely positional trading. I don't use any of that information any sorry I don't use
1:00:13
any of this information when I'm looking to buy spot position. Spot position for me is a higher time frame contextual
1:00:18
play. I'm looking to build a position over many weeks. This is purely for futures trading. All right.
1:00:31
So now that we've understood this um obviously there's a daily TPO as well.
1:00:44
What's the daily telling us again? You can measure on that previous
1:00:51
weekly. You can measure those profiles. But if you look at the daily here, can you see that 14? This thin area
1:00:58
where we're currently trading. Okay, we've really got to get above this
1:01:04
level here. There's a naked point of control there. Is this a case of all right, we we pull back and go higher.
1:01:10
Okay, you've got that sort of shift in structure or is this a case of right, reject from here and we get another move
1:01:17
down into Friday's data. Okay. Whether it happens or not and we take out these lows, that for me would be a very good
1:01:24
trade setup. All right. If if I see what I need to see from a uh micro structure
1:01:31
point of view. All right.
1:01:37
How can you refresh the DOM? Uh basically you can refresh it by
1:01:42
right clicking. All right. Let me just um right click here and reload it. And when
1:01:49
you reload the DOM, you're basically refreshing all the data
1:01:54
here essentially. All right. I normally have two DOM ladders up, one
1:02:00
with a,000 tick and one with 400 because of the volatile nature of Bitcoin. So I
1:02:05
have 400 ticks and I have uh a,000 ticks. But for the sake of this stream,
1:02:10
just to show you that I don't need to use a heat map. I don't need to look at order book skew. It's all here. It tells
1:02:16
me everything I need to know. I can see where the depth is. I can see where the asks are. I can see where the bids are.
1:02:21
I can see the today's volume profile. Okay, that's more than enough for me.
1:02:28
So, all those other tools. There's many ways you can do it. Some people prefer to look at, you know, two and a half 5%
1:02:34
skew. That's fine. Everything that I need to see is here. I I guess the advantage of 2.5 5.5% skew is that it
1:02:43
gives you aggregated data. But at the end of the day, if I'm trading on a futures exchange, I'm looking at the
1:02:49
futures data.
1:02:59
All right, so we're at 1,000 ticks. You can see today's profile. There's a value area low 113
1:03:06
one. Uh today's value developing value area high is at 14. We're about to trade
1:03:13
into that slight level of um inefficiency acceptance above 115 and
1:03:19
and any back test and continuation opens the floodgates to trade back up into 117s. Okay?
1:03:27
Because what you've then got, if you think about it, is that's one range, that's another range,
1:03:34
that's another range. Are we going to trade this lower bound of the range or are we going to shift structure
1:03:40
pullback? Then you're looking for continuation higher. Okay, that's
1:03:46
that's a probably a day trade setup that I'd be looking to take. Okay,
1:03:55
but again, this this area here now, this thin area is the sticking point. Um,
1:04:01
we've got to get acceptance above it to potentially start working our way back to 11718.
1:04:06
All right.
1:04:18
So, everything that I've just showed you, you won't see that on a candlestick chart.
1:04:30
But I've shown you from a historical context why price has reacted from
1:04:37
certain levels. Okay.
1:04:49
Right. Let's move on to Ethereum. Eth. I'll just spend five minutes on EthusT.
1:04:54
I think for me I'm currently long on Ethereum. I got an average fill of 415
1:05:01
4150. Um for me again simple play
1:05:06
looking at market profile we traded below these lows here into this level of efficiency. Inefficiency single prints
1:05:14
call it what you want. Okay this was the impulse. You can see this on a 4hour chart.
1:05:22
Even on a 1 hour chart, where did price impulsively break out from? From this level here. Okay, that's the fast move
1:05:28
up. What did we do? We filled in that inefficiency. Traded into this support zone. Price is pushing away. The
1:05:35
question I'm asking myself here is this the low on Ethereum or just as being
1:05:42
just as Bitcoin Bitcoin is at 14.4 14.5.
1:05:47
these highs in Ethereum, this level here is key for me, okay? Because
1:05:54
if we're going to come back down and trade into the low 4,000 level for one last push before we get a reversion
1:06:01
trade higher, confluent with Bitcoin, we're going to see something like this where price
1:06:08
clips these highs, comes back down for one for one more retest. Okay? Whether that's a higher low,
1:06:16
okay, or whether that's a lower low remains to be seen. And then I I would
1:06:22
suspect that there's a very good trade setup on because again something that I
1:06:28
covered on yesterday's stream. If I just remove all my levels and let's just go
1:06:33
to the daily chart. Let's look at context of price.
1:06:38
Okay. So again, I'm refining my levels from a candlestick chart because I get a
1:06:43
better view of of the price action. So, when I'm looking at the candlestick
1:06:49
chart here again, when you look at price, when we traded
1:06:55
into the all-time highs, which is here,
1:07:02
where did we pull back to and get a reaction before we saw move back up to the back up towards the near near the
1:07:09
all-time highs? It was this level here, wasn't it?
1:07:24
So when you've sold off and you found a level of support, buyers are stepping into the market, takes out the stops,
1:07:30
trades higher into the supply zone. Okay, look at the wicks around this area.
1:07:37
Okay, eventually price rolls over and then you get the big expansion below and continuation
1:07:43
lower down. This for me is that key trading range. There's my mid-level. Okay.
1:07:54
Using these levels, let's run it forward.
1:08:00
Resistance. Going to use this as a reference point.
1:08:10
Resistance. resistance and again using that previous
1:08:17
reference point. Now if you think about what price is doing here, it keeps
1:08:22
tapping away at this level. When you think about a brick wall and you've got a hammer in your hand and you strike the
1:08:30
brick wall, what are the chances that you're going to knock the brick brick wall down after one strike? Probably
1:08:38
relatively small, right? considering the strength of the brick wall. That's how I
1:08:43
view resistance. So the more attempts that you have at breaking resistance with that hammer or in this instance,
1:08:49
the more attempts price takes at breaking through resistance, eventually we'll push through it. Okay.
1:08:57
Now you look at where price has reacted from. It's towards that range low. Where are the highs? There's the alltime
1:09:03
highs. As far as I'm concerned, from a price action perspective, this is what we're trading. Okay? None
1:09:11
of this [ __ ] oh yeah, Ethereum's top, that's it. We're going lower down. I really couldn't care about what other
1:09:18
people's opinions are. And you guys shouldn't really think or care much about what my opinions are. If I think
1:09:25
we're going to go to 7,000 or we're going to go to 1,000, it doesn't matter. All I care about from a trading
1:09:32
perspective is right supply zone,
1:09:39
demand zone. If if this is resistance, look how
1:09:47
everything is starting to line up. If Bitcoin gets rejection from 14.7 to 15K
1:09:53
and Ethereum trades where into the mid rejection
1:09:59
stop above the high, you've got a chance that we could revisit into a higher low or
1:10:05
remember what we what I explained previously where where price traded again. Go back and look at price action.
1:10:14
Look at what happens. Let's re let's replay the data. So, we know that we've
1:10:20
topped out. We're looking for some form of um range lows to be established.
1:10:25
Okay? We're not trying to catch a knife. Do you bid this? Do you bid this? Do you bid this? We don't know. We just don't
1:10:31
know. Okay? But we know in hindsight where this key
1:10:37
level is. Price comes in, trades that level. Okay? You've got a
1:10:44
level of demand here. Again, using order flow and footprints, we probably would have seen aggressive selling at these
1:10:50
lows. Now, you tell me in the audience, right?
1:10:56
If you're longing this here, you've just got into long. Is your stop safe below here? What what probability or certainty
1:11:04
can you tell me now that the market is here, you've entered here? What chance is there of your stop getting run versus
1:11:10
price hitting this level first? Which one are you going for? Do you know for certain what's going to happen next? You
1:11:17
don't. All you can do is manage your execution. After that, you've got no control in terms of what the market
1:11:24
does. You have to accept that level of variance. whether price comes back and
1:11:30
takes these lows, okay, into more passive
1:11:35
bids which soak up price or if there's no demand there and aggressive selling comes into the market, we're going much
1:11:41
lower down. Okay, you don't know that by looking at this candlestick chart.
1:11:47
But you're really looking for this mid level, aren't you? From a trading perspective, right? If you've got a long
1:11:52
off here with a stop just below this level here, that's that's a fairly decent 2 and 1 half hour trade.
1:11:59
Potentially, if you really want to swing for the fences, go for the highs. 4 and 1 half hour trade. That's all you're
1:12:04
bothered about. Okay. What happens next? What do you think happens next?
1:12:22
Let's run it forward. The key thing to remember here is when we look at price
1:12:27
action. This was a fairly aggressive move down.
1:12:32
So, so you're going to get a level of inefficiency around here. Okay,
1:12:40
there's one level. And really what you're thinking about here is all right,
1:12:46
if that's one level there, if we can push up, I'm looking to take
1:12:52
profit around here because the minute we get back inside, there's a good chance we could come back down and take out
1:12:58
these lows, right? Or we make a higher low and push back up again
1:13:04
because we are in a rangebound environment, are we not?
1:13:16
That's your cue to get out the trades because you come all the way back down for a higher low.
1:13:23
Now, whether you're waiting for this higher low to get back into the trade or whether you're looking for a sweep is is
1:13:29
entirely subjective to how you trade. But what does price do?
1:13:36
Look at that. Look how much time we've spent in this area. Now, just imagine that
1:13:43
you've caught this. You're very bullish. You're thinking to yourself, you know what? I'm going to swing for this for
1:13:50
the highs here. Maybe you're fortunate. Maybe you put your stop down here. Maybe you get away with it.
1:13:56
But you've just roundt tripped all your gains. And knowing your human emotions, you're probably going to panic sell this
1:14:02
at the lows here, right? So that's why
1:14:08
over the coming weeks I think it's important to really think about price at this key resistance level. Just look to
1:14:15
trade price as a range. Okay, clearly we've shifted from trend into a form of
1:14:21
consolidation. Now let's run it forward again. Look how many times we've tested the
1:14:26
range lows. Now we're getting a push above the the the mid-range again.
1:14:34
Now, we've traded these highs, the the upper percentile of the range.
1:14:42
We've just took out this high here. You've assume you've caught the bulk of
1:14:47
the move up. You're at resistance. Stop waiting for the swing fail. Start
1:14:53
thinking about, all right, I need to start taking some partials off and where do I not want to see price trade?
1:14:59
Really, I don't want to see price come back below this level here. We've had a reaction and it's rallied. If this
1:15:05
level's going to hold, then I really need to see this hold. Otherwise, I need to start taking my profits or scaling out. Maybe I take one/3 off here. I've
1:15:12
got another third there. And maybe I've moved my stops somewhere over here.
1:15:20
Rest is history. Okay. Trade the upper percentile and the lower
1:15:26
percentiles of the range. You can avoid all this chop by taking subshitty trades
1:15:33
at these mid-levels, okay? You're going to get shredded to pieces if you're looking to to play those swing type of
1:15:39
trades from mid-range to range high or mid-range to range low, unless you really know what you're doing. Okay? So,
1:15:45
now that we've established that price has been rangebound for the best part of Tuesday the 16th of November, all the
1:15:51
way through to 4th of December, that's two weeks. Why
1:15:56
do we not think that price could do something similar, right?
1:16:01
Given where price is today. Okay,
1:16:10
this is where we are today. So again, very similar price action. We've got this key level here.
1:16:18
Let me just clean up my chart. There's that level that I marked out from the previous all-time high. Range, local
1:16:24
range low. There's a previous all-time high, local range high.
1:16:30
Previous alltime high, local range high, mid-range. Um, that's your range lows
1:16:35
now. Okay. If we run these highs and we
1:16:40
get a move back down, I'm looking to become a buyer of Ethereum. Well, I'm looking to take another long. In all
1:16:47
honesty, I start scaling out of my position. and I was trying to TX that I've cut my position. In fact, I've
1:16:52
caught most of it. I've taken profit because I've I've caught the move up. Okay. So, I'm thinking to myself, all
1:16:58
right, we could push up into the mid. But if Bitcoin rejects from 14.7 14.8
1:17:03
eight and it goes for those lows because ETH is showing relative strength.
1:17:09
Are we now likely to see, okay, a lower low or are we going to see
1:17:19
a corrective move back down respect this level here into a
1:17:26
higher low? You're looking for aggressive selling. Once price pushes away, you can start
1:17:32
scaling in. Okay, but again, you you're just looking for the mids. If you can get above the mid, then hopefully we can
1:17:38
run for the highs as well. Okay, break the trend line. That's the trigger game on. All right, fast move up is what I'd
1:17:45
want to see. The problem that we have again just like Bitcoin if Bitcoin gets
1:17:53
below 109's wasn't this a previous trading range that we had on Ethereum between 33s and
1:18:00
39s then we're in contention for trading this range here. Okay, this is one zone.
1:18:07
This is the next zone. If you're longing this from anywhere here and price is coming down, you've got to get out the
1:18:13
trade because you can always step back in. If we see acceptance back above the level, then you've got another stab to
1:18:20
go for the highs. Okay? And this is just shorts, late participants puking their positions getting trapped or maybe those
1:18:27
th those early longs have given up and then eventually the market reverts back
1:18:33
to the mid-range and then to the range highs. Okay, very similar concepts as to what I've just covered on Bitcoin. It's
1:18:39
all one big trade as far as I'm concerned, but I've shown you the levels that I'm
1:18:45
looking to trade, okay, over the coming days. All right, I don't know if this is the low. It could very well be before we
1:18:52
get a move higher. There could be a chance we come back down. The whole point of trading is not to predict,
1:18:58
okay? Your job is to react, but react with a plan ahead of time. Which levels
1:19:04
am I looking to trade and why?
1:19:30
Last few minutes and then we'll call it a wrap on the stream. But again, when you look at Ethereum purely from a
1:19:35
market profile view, okay, remember what I said about how Ethereum
1:19:41
came back down and traded this in inefficiency.
1:19:48
Well, look at look at where we pretty much bounce off of
1:19:56
40 54. That's not really a single print for me because it's only one TPO.
1:20:04
Actually, it's two TPO. So, it does it does it does count as a single print for me. Okay. But essentially, if we just
1:20:12
box off this zone here
1:20:24
and you've got this cluster here where the IV range is, this is your really
1:20:29
your invalidation point. You don't want to see ETH really getting below this low here at 39s. Okay, where did price come
1:20:36
into?
1:20:41
pushes up, trades the highs, comes back down
1:20:48
straight into that single print. Okay, yesterday and today we took out yesterday's low and we've pushed all the
1:20:55
way to 43s. Okay.
1:21:09
Now, what's important here before I wrap up, we've pushed up into 43
1:21:18
60. We've taken out yesterday's high. We're at the value area high from the previous day before, right?
1:21:25
But what I want you to really pay attention to now,
1:21:34
okay, that's the previous day value high. That's yesterday's value high. Okay. But
1:21:41
what I really want you to pay attention to is what is this level here,
1:21:47
this thin area of price that if we happen to push up into this and we
1:21:53
reject confluent with Bitcoin, then we might see a higher low or or or
1:22:00
another uh lower low over the coming days or weeks. Okay. The key for me in
1:22:06
all of this is essentially this zone here. Okay, this has to hold
1:22:12
for me. So now that you've understood the context, remember these numbers here 44
1:22:18
to 4450. Okay? And then this area between 4050
1:22:24
and 3980s.
1:22:35
4450
1:22:40
here. Okay. Almost confluent with that mid 390 to 4040.
1:22:50
That's 390. There's the uh IV range in here. This is the level that I want to
1:22:56
see stick. Okay. below here, you know that we could see a deeper
1:23:04
retracement. Okay, so this is it now almost at your mid level, give or take.
1:23:10
You've got a nice low here that such that if price comes back down, takes these out, sticks here, you've got a
1:23:18
nice invalidation to get long back towards the mids. Okay, when you think of that from a trade structure point of view, let's even do it from a on a TPO
1:23:26
chart.
1:23:35
stop just below the IB or the previous value area high. So again, you got the value area high just below. Now, I'm not
1:23:41
looking to blindly bid the level. I want to see if price does come lower
1:23:47
down. Okay, we've trade this. We do this. Okay, essentially
1:23:53
that's my execution. That's my stop there. What's my structure of the
1:23:58
trades? I can chalk up a 4hour trade.
1:24:05
If you can give me two R a week, I'll be very happy for the rest of my
1:24:11
life, trading life. Okay,
1:24:19
this is a subtlety that you can achieve when you have full understanding of the
1:24:24
context. And this is just a quick high overview. I'm trying to keep it very very simple. I haven't even talked about
1:24:31
some of the uh other aspects of market profile or how I use the IB range or looking at tails. Okay, this is an
1:24:38
example of a tail here. But you can see the granular level of information that you can get and how you
1:24:45
can trade that if we even if we reject and we don't trade these singles up here
1:24:50
and we reject lower down and take these lows. I'm targeting those single prints appear as a magnet for price.
1:25:04
I I normally hit market for crypto. I I don't do limit orders.
1:25:10
I I generally market in and then I I chase limit chase. Okay? Because I don't
1:25:16
just have one entry. I I build a position. We'll talk about risk management and position sizing in a
1:25:22
future stream, but I I've I've essentially changed the whole concept and the way that I execute
1:25:30
trades, okay? And I'll talk about that in a future stream.
1:25:35
Acceptance for me isn't time based. It's non-time based.
1:25:40
I don't really look at a candlestick chart and say 1 hour, 5 minute. I look at context and flow. It's non-time based
1:25:48
for me. Okay? Any
1:25:57
final questions and we're going to wrap up the stream. All right. I hope you found this educational. Um,
1:26:03
I will try to do do these once a month. If this type of stuff interests you, let
1:26:08
me know. Please let me know in the comments. If you're not interested, we can always go back to classic XO and just look at candlestick charts. Okay?
1:26:18
We can always do that. And if you want to keep it really simple,
1:26:25
okay, where I've just showed you a 4our setup, we can even do it like this just to make you all happy. There's the
1:26:30
highs, okay, on price.
1:26:38
Here's my 10 foot wide weekly order block. This is
1:26:43
bullish. This is a bullish order block. This has got to hold. Um, you really
1:26:49
want to see price hold this level. You might want to long from here, put your
1:26:54
stop down here, and target these highs, and you might get a 1 hour trade, 1.5 hour trade. All right.
1:27:01
Come on, guys. Seriously, [ __ ]
1:27:09
That's from 3,400 to 3,900 on a weekly order block.
1:27:17
And where do you even bid it? Here, here, down there.
1:27:22
You know, you need far a far greater level of granularity than
1:27:29
this.
1:27:39
Even on a daily, where do you put it? You know, which level are you using?
1:27:45
this one here
1:27:50
or are using this SR level here. It's pretty much guess work, isn't it? At this stage,
1:28:00
which level are you bidding?
1:28:06
All right, so I hope that's been insightful for you guys. Um, I hope that helps
1:28:12
and hopefully I wish you all a fab week ahead and and
1:28:18
a very good remainder of August. I'll probably try and do a stream in
1:28:23
September. For anybody asking to sign up to the charity mentorship, please do not
1:28:29
sign up to any mentorship. It's coming to an end. All proceeds will be given to charity. Um, I don't think I'm ever
1:28:36
going to get time to do one again, but as I've promised the members in the
1:28:42
group that I might be looking to do private streams from either from September or October
1:28:50
through to December. Again, I've never run a paid service. I've never run a paid group. So, which I'm, like I said,
1:28:58
I'm going to be running this private stream. So, if people are interested, then I'm just going to open up an x
1:29:04
amount of um pos uh spots if people want to sign up and join. Again, it's not a
1:29:10
paid service, not a paid group. I'm not asking you to make a payment, but we'll try and figure something out. And then
1:29:15
that's going to be it essentially. But that's only going to be ad hoc private
1:29:20
streams. It's not going to be like, "Hey guys, I'm doing two, three private streams a week. Sign up. Here's here's a
1:29:26
[ __ ] pay link and pay me $100. I've never charged anybody [ __ ] Right,
1:29:32
folks. Wish you all the best. If there's any questions, if there's any comments, please leave them at the end of the video. I appreciate your support and the
1:29:39
love and all the uh regulars. Like I said, I'm just a human being who enjoys
1:29:45
trading. This is my passion. If I can share my knowledge with you guys, I get to learn or teach myself twice, to
1:29:52
educate myself twice, and to share with you guys my own journey in trading. Okay? This is what I do for a living.
1:29:58
This is my passion. And if it inspires other people to become better traders, then that's more than good enough for
1:30:03
me. I don't want anything from anybody out there. All right, God bless. Wish you all the best and uh we'll catch you
1:30:11
in September. Take care. Thank you.
