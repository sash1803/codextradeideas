All right, we should be live. Just give me a quick confirmation in the chat that you can hear my voice.
0:09
Okay. And you can scream see my screen, please.
0:33
All right. All good. Yeah, audio is good. Screen is good. I've just um finished uh setting up my um mic again.
0:43
Fantastic. Good stuff. Good stuff. Awesome. Well, as always, thank
0:49
you for tuning in once again to June's Bitcoin Market review. As always,
0:56
anything said in today's video is not financial advice. It is just my view of the markets and primarily the focus is
1:04
on trading Bitcoin in terms of the futures pair.
1:09
Okay? I'm not talking about spot positioning. I'm not talking about long-term investments or holding. Absolutely. Bitcoin, as with every other
1:16
major indices and asset class out there in terms of the S&P, NASDAQ, Bitcoin, I
1:22
think they're all going significantly higher over the next 5 to 10 years.
1:28
Markets generally tend to go up and to the right. So, I think from an investment perspective,
1:35
um, if you want that type of content, then certainly this isn't the place. My
1:40
emphasis with these streams is really just to talk about trading ranges or trading the trends. How I'm looking to
1:47
trade markets overall more from a educational perspective, very rarely from a spot
1:55
perspective. Okay, so let's kick off the stream. I think let's really keep it simple to
2:02
begin with. And one of the most simplest ways that you can understand context is
2:08
by using the moving averages. Now, if we look at the 12 and the 25 weekly
2:15
EMA, at what point in the market have we had a real show of weakness? We haven't.
2:23
Okay. Since we flipped this 30k level, price has retained or remained in
2:31
a bullish trend. And every time where we have traded under the 12 and 25 weekly
2:38
bands, the key aspect and something that I've iterated on streams many times is
2:45
that it doesn't matter if price trades below the bands. Okay, we never got a
2:52
crossover of the bands. And secondly, the other aspect is every time we have
2:57
lost the bands, okay, we've generally consolidated under the bands. And the
3:02
first show of strength is when price, just as it did back in February 2023, is
3:08
reclaimed back above the bands. And again, you can see how price, if I just zoom into the charts, it's something
3:13
that I've covered on stream throughout the last 12 months that every time there's been a correction and we
3:20
compress under the bands and we reclaim the weekly bands, we see continuation higher. Okay, the same happened here
3:26
back in the summer of 2024. We had a period of rangeband price action. In a
3:32
rangebound environment, okay, price comes off a trend. It's either going to
3:38
distribute or consolidate. Okay. And when you see price consolidating but no real continuation in terms of breakdown,
3:44
you want to be buying up these lows here. Okay. And what gives you further weight or reasoning to get behind the
3:50
trend is acceptance back above the 12 and the 25 weekly EMAs. Okay. So that's
3:57
the point that I want to make in in terms of high time frame context. If you go to my stream back in um
4:04
March or early April, one of the key things that I talked about when price I
4:11
believe was trading in this region over here is this pivotal area here. This
4:16
compression before we saw expansion higher that that that was the previous all-time highs on the left. Okay, this
4:23
compression into expansion was the demand zone that I clearly talked about in terms of this is the level that I'm
4:30
looking to reload or pick up some spot plays. Okay, we've had a very good
4:35
reaction from there. Okay, we've had a a significant consolidation, a thrust up,
4:41
another consolidation, another thrust up, consolidation, and finally up at the highs. Yes, we've traded above the
4:47
highs. We've traded back below t uh taken out these lows here. Okay, that
4:52
that 100 level is essentially what I've been talking about on the timeline. We've had a very good reaction from
4:58
there helped by the fact with the uh Elon Musk Donald Trump spat. I think the
5:04
key observation for me here was the fact that equities and NASDAQ wasn't really selling off whilst Bitcoin was trading
5:10
lower down. So that for me was just a shaking out of positions running these lows here. and we've seen a fairly good
5:16
bid back up. Now, again, we were talking about the weekly time frame. There's nothing here just yet in my opinion to
5:24
be concerned about when it comes to the the overall structure of the trend is very good. Okay, at no point in
5:31
time have I had any real concern that okay, we're about to drop into a bare
5:37
market or go significantly lower. And that has been my stance and it continues to be my stance since the moment we've
5:45
traded above 30k. The only time or the only period that I'm looking for shorts
5:50
is hedging at range highs. Okay, this is the only logical area that I've really
5:55
considered shorts from hedging against my spot holdings.
6:02
Every time prices traded above that level, let go of the hedge. let spot
6:07
carry on doing the leg work for your portfolio. Okay, that's the only thing that I can
6:12
add with regards to how I'm managing my spot positioning. But the overall trend is
6:19
very very positive. Now when we go into the 3-day chart again
6:26
every consolidation within a range okay and you often get the chop of
6:33
the moving averages this is the consolidation and type of the chop that you will see many people struggle to
6:39
trade but the way to trade this is to keep it very simple in terms of just looking at the extremities don't do not
6:46
if you cannot trade the lower time frames then do not trade the lower time frames unless unless you have a proven
6:52
edge or you have a positive expectancy in trading price action in these
6:57
intraday intrae moves. But really where you want to be focusing upon is at the
7:03
extremities of a range because they are your high time inflection points. And so what you generally have
7:10
is in a rangeband environment when you see the moving averages price trades
7:15
below it gets above gets below gets above. Okay, there's a lot of what people would consider chop, but if
7:22
you're a range trader like I am, okay, where you've got a range between 54,000 and 72 and the fact that price was in
7:29
this range from March all the way through to November, these are some very very good trading opportunities. I'm not
7:35
talking about investments purely, talking about from a range trading perspective. These are some of the best
7:41
opportunities that you were going to get to trade the market. But the key thing is there wasn't really any sign of
7:48
weakness. U because generally when there is a sign of weakness and we do have a form of a you know loss of trend and
7:55
there's a shift in trend then you really would see expansion from the bands with
8:01
acceleration with the flows into the next objective level in terms of demand.
8:07
But when you see price oscillate and gravitate and rotate back and forth to the mean, the mean being the middle,
8:13
okay, clearly illustrates the fact that we are in a trending environment and that you shouldn't get too caught up on
8:20
the moving averages crossing under or crossing over until you have a clean break of the range. Because when you
8:26
have a clean break of the range, what do you see from the moving averages? Well, it's very simple. You do not want to be
8:32
on the wrong side of the trend because if you look at the velocity and the trajectory of the bands, this is the
8:38
direction that you want to be flowing with until momentum stalls, price
8:43
develops a range, then you can start thinking about taking profits or hedging at the highs and you're looking to play
8:49
the longs from the range lows until you get acceptance out of the range. Okay? And so in this instance when I look at a
8:58
price here once again just keeping it very simple it's trading within the
9:04
upper bound the upper bound of the range and these are our range lows. This is all I'm focusing on at this moment in
9:11
time until there's a shift in context until there's a break out of this range
9:16
with high volume you want to be flowing with that trend higher. Okay, you do not want to be shorting the momentum if
9:23
price starts trading above this level. You might get a breakout, okay, of this level, a pullback. Okay, many people
9:30
will start calling this a deviation, but like I've illustrated previously is that
9:35
sometimes when you have price drop back into a range, you'll have people fading
9:40
this or shorting this. And if it's short-lived in terms of it can't push down any lower, the minute this starts
9:47
pushing back up, they will add or serve as fuel for the move up higher. Okay? And we we kind of saw that happen last
9:55
year in November because if you look at the range highs here, it's very easy to have think, oh, look, you know, we've
10:00
we've we've potentially got a swing fail at this level. We've just taken the highs. Let me start shorting this. But
10:06
really objectively when you look at this, the fact that we've consolidated
10:11
in a range for several months and the fact that we are still trading above the mid of this range
10:20
gives me no real concern. And for those of you who watch my streams, the the context was very clear. Start looking
10:26
for higher prices. So what you have in this instance is yes, you run the highs just about or run an equal
10:32
high straight into the consolidation. Look at the thrust up. Okay, the first
10:37
candle out and you see no pullbacks and continuation higher. All right, so in
10:43
this instance again it becomes very dangerous trying to fade this move if it's going
10:50
to go higher. You might be fortunate if you get the pullback but even still even
10:56
if you do get the pullback above these highs, all right, price pushes up, pulls back inside, it's very easy to assume,
11:03
right? That's that's that's the deviation. That's a short. But bear in mind that if this is shortlived, it's
11:08
not going to [ __ ] about. It's going to keep on going significantly higher and there will be a shift in the trend. So
11:14
when you now pull it back and look at the moving averages again, even on the 3-day chart, and I'm just illustrating
11:20
context using something as simple as a set of moving averages to keep you on
11:25
the right side of the market as the market trends. You can see in this instance, okay,
11:31
we've traded above the bands, we've traded under, and we're back above those bands. Okay, for as long as price is
11:36
above the 3-day bands, I don't have any concerns. Any selling off or any selling off into
11:42
95s or 100s is or what I perceive to be an opportunity to position into another
11:49
long again. Okay? And that's just purely based upon the high time frame context. Is that
11:55
clear? Any questions so far?
12:02
And even when you look at the daily trend, okay, if there was real inherent weakness in terms of the selloff that we
12:08
had from the other day, well, whatever weakness there
12:14
was as we were compressing between these two bands, if I now run this
12:21
forward, okay, this would have kept price as resistance. If we were going to
12:28
reject, we would have rejected from this level here. From a daily
12:34
perspective, we've taken out these lows here. My level, the level that I wanted to long was the single prints that I
12:42
talked about. So, what is a single print? It's where you have price inefficiency or or there's an imbalance
12:47
of price and you have a thin area. Okay, all this here was a thin area in terms of price. That's what I wanted to see
12:53
price trade into. We pretty much tagged the top of the single prints closed back
12:59
inside acting as a daily swing fill of this level. That for me was the reason to buy. Now if there was resistance
13:05
here, if this was to to be a shift in context, then I suspect this level
13:11
should have held and we could have then at that point traded into trend continuation where you've got a low, a
13:17
lower low, a lower high, okay? Followed by um rejection into another lower low.
13:23
then you could have said right we're into 97s and 95s but when you look at the context of
13:29
price the fact that we have not only just pushed back up into the
13:35
bands that's a fairly significant move back above the bands. Okay. And so now
13:42
just using the the basic principles of the 1225 EMA which would have kept you
13:49
on the right side of the market again when you're when you're breaking down on the dailies. Okay, in a rangebound
13:54
environment, you can see the chop. You want to be focusing at the extremities or the key support or demand zones here.
14:02
The minute you lose that with the reversion back into the bands, this was that throw back into this rangebound
14:09
distribution environment before we saw one, two, three drives at the lows into this demand zone. Pushes back above.
14:16
Look at the compression above the bands. Then you start flowing with momentum. Okay? And it's the same here. There's no
14:22
real sign of weakness until price starts trading back below those bands again for me. And if it does, even if we do take
14:29
out these highs and trade back above and below, then that just tells me that all right, we are likely then to remain in a
14:36
rangebound environment. And that is likely to be the focus for the remainder
14:42
of Q2 heading into Q3. Um, and so that's kind of the high time frame context what
14:48
I'm looking at and what I'm looking for where should price trade the highs. I'm going to be looking for a potential risk
14:56
scenario where I can go defensive should price break above the highs, pull back,
15:01
show continuation. So you've got a lot of people wanted to short a potential deviation, but that aggressive selling
15:08
on the order flow is being absorbed. So there's a lot of effort. Okay. in in
15:14
terms of effort. I'll give you an example here. So, one of the things that I talked about on the timeline back
15:21
in I believe when we had these highs here. Okay. From
15:26
109's to 112s, one of the key things that I talked about on the timeline was
15:32
that there's a lot of aggression in terms of buying. There's a real effort
15:38
to lift the offers, okay, but there's no continuation. So the amount of the amount of effort
15:44
and the amount of momentum to get price to break high, it should have taken off. So all that aggressive buying up here,
15:52
we're just slamming into these passive asks, okay, who are reloading. So essenti essentially that is a sign of
15:58
absorption. You could potentially call it uh exhaustion as well because price started
16:04
um the aggression and the flow started slowing down. The the tape speed slows
16:09
down in that environment. And so you realize that hang on a minute there, there's a possible shift of context here
16:15
because if you look at the the candle structure, what was capping price up at the highs? Okay, despite the fact that
16:22
aggressive longs kept buying this up, buying this up, buying this up into these passive
16:28
asks, they were being absorbed. And so once these aggressive buyers, okay, and
16:35
aggressive buyers doesn't necessarily equate to just long positions opening, it can also include anybody who's
16:42
shorting this. Well, they become forced buyers because they have to close out their position, which fuels the move
16:47
even higher. Okay? So, it's not always just new longs are opening. It can also be a combination of well, anybody who's
16:54
offside is puking their position, therefore becoming a buyer to close out their trade.
17:04
Does that make sense? So when you see people talking about longs are trapped, not necessarily. They're not always new
17:11
positions or fresh positions that are being opened. It could be a combination
17:16
of shorts closing, longs opening. And the way you can ascertain that is
17:22
generally by looking at the open interest and the CVD to to to get an
17:28
idea or a ballpark idea, you know, as to as to what the flows are telling you
17:33
under the hood. And so what happens when you don't
17:40
get
17:46
continuation, you get an unwinding of positions. Okay. And then you you've got to think to
17:52
yourself, well, okay, if price is breaking down here, what's the real objective of price? For me, it was
17:58
coming back into that one or two to 100 level. Okay, you got the single prints
18:03
here. Price trades into that
18:09
zone. And so you can see the momentum in terms of structure. If I just pause price, one of the key things that you
18:16
want to be looking for on these moves up and you'll be amazed how clean price
18:22
action is on the way up because you never really break structure. You've got a higher lows, equal lows there or
18:29
thereabouts. Okay? Really wouldn't call this a breaking structure. It's just another higher low in context to this.
18:36
So if you notice how close price comes right in terms of looking to take out
18:42
the level but it just falls short and so you get continuation higher and then the same again it's it's almost a level of
18:48
compression here right because you've got price it's not really a range it's more of a
18:54
compression and then it pushes up again and then what do you have at this level the same happens again you've got higher
19:01
low another higher low another higher low so if you notice if you look at the subtleties of market structure structure
19:06
or micro structure in this instance. So, well, market structure because we're on the 4hour chart, but I'll talk about micro structure very shortly. You can
19:14
see how price is still respecting these lows. And so, if there is a pullback,
19:19
you're either going to get a higher low or you want to see a swing fail that's
19:24
very shortlived because what you do not want to see is price retesting the underside and then pushing away. Then
19:31
you've got a problem. Okay? So, bearing in mind You will see this and this is a way to
19:38
validate the overall context of price. What price is telling you? Okay, which
19:44
direction do you want to be flowing with
19:53
price and so we get a level of resistance capping price and we start trading down.
20:00
Okay, again many people will be inclined to buy this because they think, oh look, we're into this demand. But the
20:06
concerning factor for me was this was in terms of local structure. We shifted
20:12
structure here. Okay, this was your consolidation. This was your supply zone, right? That's your supply zone up
20:18
here. This was the rangeb area. We broke below the range. We're pushing away respecting structure. Okay, don't mind a
20:24
push up back up into here. Then drop down again. Okay, the minute this happens and we get back under, that's
20:30
kind of your context or your trigger that we're about to go lower to take out these lows here, potentially trade into
20:35
these
20:41
lows. And so you get that push. We take out these highs here. We're trading to 107s. The fact that we start getting
20:47
back into this zone here and we can't seem to push back above this zone here is where you want to pay attention.
20:57
Okay, there you go. That was it. Now, the beauty of this chart here was
21:04
that if I just remove everything and in terms of context, what is this candle
21:09
here? What does that look like to you? What candle? What do we call this candle? This candle
21:16
type. The fact that we have taken out all the lows here, we've closed back inside. Is this
21:23
or is this not a bullish pin bar close on the 4hour
21:34
chart? Okay. And even when you look at the daily, that was a daily swing fail. So
21:40
you have a clear invalidation point to get long upon acceptance back
21:46
inside this range. And therefore the range that we
21:52
are trading in my opinion is from A to B. That's the range that I'm concerned
22:00
with for the time being. Okay? In terms of overall price
22:05
structures until there's a shift of context. We're either going to get above here or we're going to get below here.
22:11
Then we can start thinking about, you know, potentially trading back into 90K. Now, when you zoom out and you map price
22:19
across the line at these highs, okay, and at this low, this is your
22:27
mid-level effectively, okay? It doesn't get any cleaner than that. You have a
22:32
series of lows being respected. You have wouldn't call these the cleanest of
22:38
highs, but I prefer this high now because this is the latest level. Now in terms of swing fail, the previous swing
22:45
fail was this. Well, not so much a swing fail, but taking out the highs, okay? And rejecting from this supply zone. So
22:53
in terms of context, in terms of structure, in terms of pattern, that's the range that I'm paying attention to
23:02
where anything outside is either likely to be an opportunity for trend
23:08
continuation or we always have to be aware of could
23:14
this potentially revert from this level back into the mid or back into 105s. All
23:20
right. So if I now map this out in terms of forming the overall
23:26
range, this is my immediate range low and this is all I'm focusing in terms of
23:32
context because this is where the majority of the price action has been. And then this serving as my range high.
23:40
This particular level here on the left is where we traded above, got back
23:45
below. We had the perfect underside retest. We sold off into the mid of this
23:52
range from 100 to 109 is the range that I talked about to look out for and the
23:59
range that I'm looking to
24:06
trade. All right. If you go to if you go to my tweet on Sunday the
24:14
1st or whenever it was Monday the 2nd, this is what I talked about in terms of what I'm looking at in terms of price
24:20
is for price to trade into the single prints either 100s or 97s. This previous
24:27
uh last high pre-break, okay, was the level or this level here. And overall in
24:33
terms of what I'm looking at is from A to B. That's it.
24:40
Everything else in between for me is noise. Okay? I'm not interested in trading. I'm only interested in
24:46
positioning here or here or down at these lows here. Three zones that I'm
24:51
looking to trade to keep it very simple. Let's push on now. Okay. So, the previous supply zone was
24:58
between 109.7 into
25:04
112s. Okay. We're at 110.2 at this moment in
25:13
time. When you look at the the 1 hour chart, again, very simple
25:21
structural aspects of price will tell you that lower high, lower high, lower
25:28
high. At what point have we broken structure to the downside to suggest that all right there's a chance now that
25:35
we could get a pullback. There hasn't been
25:41
anything. And so even with a simple set of moving averages again even if you just look at the 1 hour time
25:49
frame the trend is keeping you on the right side of the market whichever way you look at it.
25:56
Even the 4hour, there's nothing here to suggest that I want to be selling this
26:01
or look for rejections at this level. Look at the trend continuation.
26:07
We're heading back into or towards now this key zone here where we had the
26:13
previous supply zone. This is where the market sold off previously. So I suspect at some point probably today that we
26:21
will take out this high or get very close to taking the high out. After that
26:26
I can't get euphoric. I'm not going to fall into the trap. I think you just have to remain level-headed. You will
26:32
see a lot of again sentiment shift at these highs. Okay. People start getting
26:38
excited. People you'll start people talking about 140k targets. Okay, which is all
26:43
fine, which is all well and good. I'm sure we will get there eventually, but as a trader, I want to remain cognizant
26:50
of the fact that we have CPI on Wednesday, right? We've had quite the extensive move today in terms of
26:58
Monday's range. So, what I'm looking at is not areas
27:05
where I can short from, but areas where I can possibly see a pullback and I can
27:11
look to buy or if there's a a shift in structure, then where do I need to be more
27:17
defensive and start playing this range again? Okay, that we're
27:24
in because that's that's all we're in. we are still within this range. Until
27:29
that changes, until there's a shift in context, can I have confidence that we're going to go up to 120s, 130s?
27:36
Okay, that's the target. My target was around about 125 130 from the high time
27:42
frame chart. That's that's the level that I want to see traded up
27:49
there. So, for now, as far as I'm concerned, it's still a range. Okay? and
27:55
the fact that we've we've not really had any meaning pull any meaningful
28:01
pullback from this level here. Okay, it's again the
28:06
risk-to-reward was fantastic. The risk-to-reward appears shocking for longs. Okay, because at some point
28:14
whether this takes the highs, there will be a pullback. I'd much rather wait for the pullback if I don't have a long
28:20
position to consider getting back into the position again. Okay, if I don't have a position, thankfully I do. Okay,
28:26
but if I didn't, I would not be chasing this because now you've got to ask yourself, if you look at the origin of
28:32
this move up, okay, rally, consolidation, another rally, I don't
28:37
want to be chasing this. You want to be chasing the consolidations at the bases in line with the set of moving averages
28:42
or supports. You get the break above this previous consolidation area, we go back into the highs. All right, so here
28:49
you just want to be cautious around this 110 level.
28:57
Now when I say cautious I'm talking about the fact that opening fresh longs into
29:12
resistance and again when you look at
29:17
Bitcoin I can give you a number of instances where these types of moves have happened time and time again. And
29:25
again, when we get at the highs, when we come to the highs, there's a real shift in sentiment. But you've really got to
29:31
be watching the flows here to see what's happening. Are aggressive buyers being absorbed again? Okay. A lot of
29:38
aggressive selling on the way up from shorts, even down here where
29:45
this clearly looks like a a classic T-W. Okay, they were just being absorbed by
29:50
passive bids. So basically what was happening in this instance was that when I was watching the flow here is that
29:57
passive bids were absorbing okay any aggressive selling. So when
30:04
sellers are stepping into the market trying to push price down all that effort is just being absorbed by these
30:10
passive bids and then and then at the same time whilst these passive bids are holding price and and absorbing
30:18
any aggressive selling you've got market buy orders which are pushing which is pushing price higher. And so when market
30:25
orders are also coming in and price is being supported by passive bids, what do you think is going to happen to anybody
30:31
who say shorted this here and their stop is there? Well, they're going to get tagged offside, right? When they get
30:37
tagged offside, they're going to close. Causes price to push higher.
30:46
Okay. So again, it was a classic case of aggressive buying supported by passive
30:54
bids. And again, anybody who's looking to aggressively short this, there was a lot of aggression in terms of shorting
31:00
this uh down candle here for not much reward. And so when they're
31:05
offside, you can even see from the price action in terms of the candle bodies here, how price kept rejecting this
31:11
level here. And eventually once it popped through, well, it's a combination
31:16
of intraday breakout traders combined with anybody who's tried to short this
31:22
has got stopped out causing price to push up higher. Okay. And so now we're into this key
31:29
area of supply where the market broke down previously. Not a level where I
31:35
would get bullish into in terms of opening a new position. If anything, I I've been scaling out of my per longs
31:41
here.
31:47
Okay. But what what I've just said in terms of the flows of price, how once
31:54
you get this aggressive sell off and price is being bid up bid up bid up bid up, right? And it's absorbing any
32:01
aggressive selling by passive limits and market orders are lifting the offers.
32:06
That's what you want to be watching for in the flow. But why is all this aggressive selling unable to push price?
32:12
You can watch it on the tape. You can watch it on the dom. You can see it on the
32:18
footprints. But price is still going higher. And we're respecting market
32:28
structure. Just give me two seconds, guys. I just want to pop something open.
32:47
any questions so far before um I start zoning in on the uh the lower time frame
32:53
price action.
33:21
I'm just going through the questions here. Sorry if I'm just taking a minute
33:28
out. No, we're not swinging failing right now. For me, this isn't a swing fail. This is something that you don't
33:34
want to [ __ ] fade. That's what it is. And and the problem is, believe me,
33:40
because I've I've made my fair share of mistakes over the years when I'm trying to short an aggressive market. I've
33:46
learned from my mistakes over the years. That's why I say the trader that I was in 2122, I've evolved even from 2023. I
33:55
don't look back at 21, 22, 23 and think, "Oh, yeah, you know, um, I'm still the same trader." [ __ ] It's like you
34:02
have to evolve. You have to learn as you gain more screen time.
34:09
Okay, Manuel, do you suggest to keep I wouldn't suggest anything. It's up to you to make that decision. I've been
34:16
taking profit because in 4 days, we've gone from 100 to 110. Thank you very
34:21
much. I'll I'll definitely pay myself. You know, for me, it's a range until it's proven otherwise. If we get the
34:27
breakout, the beauty of being a fluid trader is I know how to get back into a
34:32
position if we're going to trade out. If we're going to fake out the highs, okay, which I'll cover this scenario, then I
34:39
know exactly where to get defensive with a stop at the highs. If it's going to go higher, I know if it starts pushing back
34:44
up towards here and reclaims this level, I need to get the [ __ ] out the trade. Punt a stop here, go long, look for the
34:51
breakout trade into thin air. Okay? then you will get trend continuation higher. But what I will tell you is that
34:59
again my point about shorting the markets in the charity mentorship that
35:05
I've been running, I've been going over this with members in there, right? Um how to stay on side because look what
35:11
what generally happens is it's it's all easy to to think, oh look, you know,
35:19
this has been an extensive move today on price. let me start shorting this, right? It's easy to get sucked up or
35:25
sucked into that mentality. But the the reality is even
35:30
if you just look at this here, let me just bring up another chart. In
35:38
fact, the reality is look, even just with a simple set of moving averages,
35:44
right? You will not again when you when you
35:49
look at price action
35:54
here. We're still being supported by the bands. And even when you look at price
36:02
action, what you really want to be seeing is a low time frame range. Okay, this
36:07
then gives you more reason that hang on a minute. If you look at this, this was on the 22nd of May and we traded here
36:14
for the best part of 2 three days. Okay, two days, right? But look at the the the
36:19
rangeband environment that we had and then look at the lower time frame shift. You want to at least wait on the lower
36:25
time frames for a shift in that context to give you a reason that hang on a minute. Is this consolidation before the
36:33
move higher or is this now becoming key word here low time frame distribution
36:40
within this leg here and so one of the things that I've covered at the start of the stream is that well when you see the
36:48
trajectory of price you don't want to be fading this right you do not want to be stepping in front of this but when you
36:53
see price print a high and a low and then equal highs there's a fairly pretty decent
37:00
chance that if you can start gravitating or oscillating back into here, you've got a nice range
37:08
formed. Now, for once, now the question is, is this breakout continuation or are
37:13
we to start trading lower down? And this is then where your mid level comes into play. You've got your mid level. Okay,
37:19
if this was bullish after testing these lows once, twice, reclaims the mid, but
37:26
it fails to hold, that's your short there with the stop at the highs. You're selling 111s with a stop at
37:33
112s until you see price find acceptance back above this this high here. Okay?
37:40
And when you look across the line, what happened? We sold off. Okay?
37:47
That's you've got more time than you think when it comes to becoming defensive or switching context in the
37:55
view that we might just retrace this move up that we've had. We might just retrace down here um over the coming
38:02
week or so. And now when you look at this, we've essentially filled in all
38:07
this inefficiency on the way down. This was the origin for the entirety of this move move down here. This this point up
38:17
here was this leg down here. By reclaiming this
38:24
level, that's where we are. And this was this here was for buying at these lows.
38:29
So now I'm I'm I'm leaning into becoming defensive or taking profits. I'm not looking to open new longs
38:38
here. And that's the problem, right? The the thing is you if you try and fade
38:43
this you might get lucky you might get away with it but in terms of my own system when I
38:49
look at this according to my system I I can't fade this right the 2021 X I would have
38:57
probably started thinking of shorting this and and by shorting it I probably would have had to stop at these highs
39:02
here I would have got taken out and price goes higher fine I get the risk to reward behind it but have We at any
39:11
point in time developed a range even here. No, we haven't. This has been a clean trend. Compression expansion.
39:18
Okay. Until there's a range formed here and there's a slowdown in momentum. Can
39:24
I then think about all right, I think we're stalling out here over the next 12 24 hours. If we're just consolidating
39:30
and oscillating in between 10 109 and 111, then I can say all right that
39:35
there's possible cause here to to start thinking about becoming defensive because we are stalling at these highs.
39:41
We've got CPI on Wednesday. Maybe we're going to see a level of hedging into the market. Okay. And maybe those hedges
39:47
come off. So if there is a correction, then where am I targeting? Well, it's very simple for me. I'm targeting
39:55
effectively if we bring back our range. I'm targeting this mid zone here.
40:03
That's the range that I'm looking to trade where this is the supply zone up here.
40:39
and for me we are still in a range. Okay, as far as I'm concerned it low
40:45
time frame it's a range high time frame it's a range and so therefore I'm I'm
40:50
anticipating you know further rotations until we we have a breakout of this range here.
40:58
Okay. Now, what I want to bring your attention to is Bitcoin has this habit
41:09
where Bitcoin has this habit where it does these types of moves, right? Price, you know, it's been rallying. It
41:16
distributes for a bit. You know, sometimes you get a round of retest, it breaks down, consolidates. Okay. So,
41:27
sells off, reconsolidates, sells off again, takes out some some some low
41:34
here. Okay? And then what it does, it just retest all this move down
41:41
here. It just does something like this and then bang and then again and then it'll trade
41:48
the highs. Everybody gets excited and it comes back all the way down again.
41:53
And what I don't like about this move is is all this, which makes it very easy for price
41:59
to come all the way back down. And I'll give you an example of this right
42:07
there. Again, when you look at the move here, once again, what has Bitcoin done?
42:14
Taking out all the the respective lows into this demand zone here. Okay,
42:20
cleared it all up. All these lows here got wiped out. Rally.
42:27
Okay. 4our compression. Is there any pullback? No, there isn't. If you look at the
42:33
market structure, higher low, higher low,
42:38
higher low, another higher low, another higher low. Shorts keep piling in. They're offside. Everybody, you know,
42:45
shorts trying to sell push this down, but they they're getting absorbed and price is pushing higher. So if you if
42:51
you look at the the aggression of this
43:09
move, go to the 4 hour and then boom, you just get a a
43:16
fairly aggressive selloff. You get a move up. Okay. And again, this was at the highs. It's
43:24
very easy to get carried away thinking, you know what, game on, we're going much
43:40
higher. Then the key thing is look at all this rangebound price action within
43:45
here. So, we didn't get the trend continuation. We got a swing fail. We're sold off. We pushed back up. But really,
43:51
when you look under the hood, instead of trying to short this here, here, and
43:57
here, and then here, right, you've got more time than you think because you
44:02
have a clearly defined range. And until there's a a clear breakout, okay, this is this is your supply zone here, which
44:09
is capping price. This is your uh demand zone or your local range.
44:15
you could easily latch onto the tail side of the point I'm trying to make is you have a lot more time than you think as with this example here into
44:23
price discovery look at the the the loss of momentum for the best part of two
44:28
days right we can't seem to get any candle closes above here and so then what does price do comes all the way
44:35
back down into the lows and then then from the lows what does price do back
44:40
into the highs consolidates redistributes trades into
44:48
101s. Got all this to fill in if it's going to come lower down. So, you can see how choppy price action has been.
44:55
And then we're back into the demand zone, still within that
45:00
range. So, the the point of of what I just showed you there is that don't get too aggressive when
45:08
you're trying to fade these moves. It's it it's not worth it. Okay.
45:13
death by a thousand cuts.
45:22
Now, any good trader will be aware of the downside
45:27
scenario or the downside risk. Okay, this isn't about being bearish or
45:33
bullish. Okay, I practically couldn't give a [ __ ] about being bearish or bullish. Those words are not in my
45:40
strategy. It's not part of my vocabulary. If I see a setup, I will take that setup. If I see price come to
45:46
the range highs, I'll get defensive. If I see price come to the range lows, I'll be aggressive. That's it.
45:52
Okay? Whether I'm selling or whether I'm buying, it all depends on context.
45:59
Now, I want to bring your attention to
46:05
this fractal here. And I call it a fractal because when you look at the weekly
46:11
chart on
46:17
Bitcoin, one thing I want you to remember is when price sold off here,
46:22
there was already concerns about the economy. Okay? There was already concerns about interest rates,
46:28
inflation. There was talks about the Fed tapering. Okay? We we weren't even cutting rates at this point. So, so for
46:36
me that the reason why I became bearish at these highs, okay, is because of the
46:42
the shift in policy, the talk of tapering. And so for me, that's when I became very aggressively defensive
46:49
because we we took out these highs. We find acceptance back inside. If I'm going to get back into the market
46:56
as a buyer, price has to prove to me that all right, Exo, for you to buy back
47:02
into the market, the fact that you've hedged here, you sold here, I'm looking for price to get back above this level.
47:08
That's all there is to it. Why the [ __ ] would I want to incur significant draw down on the way
47:16
down when price is already showing me that hang on a minute, there's a problem here. Why are we not pushing higher
47:23
until this can get back above here? Fine, let's go. We can all celebrate.
47:29
But I'm not going to be celebrating holding a spot bag and watching this come all the way down back into these lows
47:39
here. And so rule number one as a trader, it's about preserving your capital. By preserving your capital or
47:46
not blowing out or incurring significant losses, can then can you only then make
47:52
profits and realize profits and pay yourself? Because if you're going to
47:58
incur losses and significant draw down, how the [ __ ] are you ever going to make money? And again, I'm not talking from
48:04
being a long-term investor. If if you're a long-term investor, send your send your bitcoins
48:10
to a cold wallet and just leave them there for 101 15 years. You'll be absolutely fine. Okay, I've got a stash
48:15
of Bitcoin that I'm not going to touch anymore. That's it. But I still believe that as a trader, I can make very good
48:23
money. And by making that by making good money, I'm buying more more Bitcoin with those profits. Essentially, that's all
48:29
I'm looking to do. But the key thing is the key thing here, you have to be aware of the
48:35
downside. Now, why I'm bringing this to your attention, I'm not really big on
48:41
fractals, but it it's just it's so don't misunderstand or misinterpret what I'm telling you here. The whole point of
48:47
this next exercise is really hard to make you think objectively on what are the risks. If you see any impending
48:54
risks from a price action perspective, then how the [ __ ] can you take action as opposed to just sitting there hoping
49:00
price goes higher, but every day price is dropping lower. Now you are not
49:05
willing to cut the trade because you're waiting for a bounce which never comes and then it drops even lower and then
49:10
before you know it prices at 90k again right as a trader not talking about an
49:16
investor here. So the point I want to make is well again when you look at
49:22
price action here what did we do in 2021? We took out
49:28
these highs very similar price action to what we've just had. Okay. Not only did we
49:34
take out the highs, but a real [ __ ] ton of effort. I remember trading this with the order flow. A real [ __ ] ton of
49:41
effort came in here. But what did we do on the 4hour chart? We sold off. We
49:47
traded traded into these lows here. All right. Brilliant buying opportunity.
49:53
This has been holding up as support, right? Everybody's getting bullish here. We've got the breakout,
49:59
new highs. Woohoo. Let's [ __ ] go. But we get back inside, we sell back off
50:06
into demand. So now when you look at this, the the immediate range, okay, even on a
50:13
1 hour time frame, is you're thinking to yourself, all right, look, we we've got this low here. This is a higher low,
50:20
these are higher lows, this is a equal lows here. I don't mind a swing fail.
50:25
I'm back inside. And I think we're going to go straight to the highs. or this is the the lower the higher low which
50:33
respects these lows here. So it's one of these two scenarios where I'm looking to long. For me the the easiest scenario is
50:39
a swing fail because then it tells me like right if we swing fill these lows here I know there's a chance that I will
50:45
get taken out unless price is ready to come lower down then I know that [ __ ] it's time to get out. But when price
50:51
stops here it's like you're kind of scratching for an entry because you don't know if you're going to get a swing fail lower down. And even if you
50:57
do get a swing for fail lower down and it rejects on the underside, you got problems, right? So this is why it's
51:04
critical that you have a few variations of your execution strategy.
51:10
Now quite often so many of you wait for the swing fill and it never comes and it leaves you behind. Other times you'll
51:17
buy this and you'll get stopped out. Man up. Losing or being stopped out
51:22
is part of the game and taking small losses is part of the game. You have to get the [ __ ] back into the trades. If
51:29
you if you see price swing fail this, don't just bottle it because price has taken you out and you've you've taken a
51:34
loss for the day and you see a swing fail and get back inside, you've got to go with that. Okay, in terms of the
51:40
order flow, if you see aggressive selling, okay, not shorts, aggressive selling, what does that mean? What does
51:46
aggressive selling mean? Okay, so many people confuse aggressive selling or shorts are piling in here. No,
51:52
aggressive selling means that look, anybody who's got their stop under here or is long from here, they're going to puke their position and you've probably
51:59
got a [ __ ] ton of uh passive bids waiting to to to soak up all that
52:04
aggressive selling. Not necessarily shorts opening. Yes, it will be a combination of shorts, but it will also
52:10
be a combination of anybody who tried to long this is going to capitulate and give it up give up their position here
52:16
because they think they're going to we're going to get a breakdown. But failure to get back inside. Okay, sorry.
52:22
Fail. When you see price showing you a level of acceptance, you go and okay, why has why has price turned around from
52:28
this level? Why are we now getting an acceptance back inside here? Is it because there was a level of aggression that couldn't push the market lower
52:35
down? Therefore, these sellers are exhausted and it's time to step back inside because now the the objective is
52:41
to go back into the mid and from the mid into the range
52:47
high. Let's see what happens. Which scenario do we get? Anybody want to take a guess? Was it scenario number one
52:53
where this is a lower high or was it scenario two where we take out some of these lows potentially this low here
52:59
then we wait for the trigger to go back inside or do we start scaling in here stop at the low we're going to get stopped out and then we get the trigger
53:06
to go back inside again. Two attempts at taking the trade. Okay. Which which one are you going to
53:12
pick? Number one or number two. And number three is a cut and
53:18
reverse. Okay. I I've talked about the cut and reverse exercise on my uh substack. It's a very good exercise to
53:24
practice switching contexts and switching buyers. Number three would have been all right, we break down, we
53:31
test the underside, we start pushing lower down, stop at the highs, you want
53:37
to see price start selling this. If we can take out these lows, we're going to go lower into this level and then this
53:43
demand zone down here at at 54s. Okay, that's what it would have been. So, you got two trade setups. You can go long
53:51
into the mid or you can go short. If you get a reason to go short, if you've had one or two attempts at this and this is
53:56
failing, cut and reverse, go the other
54:02
way. Right, let's run it forward. Let's see what we
54:11
get. Look at that. You bought this. If I bought this, I would have got stopped
54:16
out. Now I'm waiting to either get back into a long. And to get back into a long,
54:22
well, guess what? I'm now going to reshift this lower down as my demand zone to be here. I need to see price get
54:31
back above this level here now. Okay. If we can't get back above here, I need to
54:36
see get back above here before I can get a trigger. But again already, what can you
54:43
tell by looking at price? What can what what is this price action showing you here on the 1 hour time frame? Look at
54:49
the wicks. Okay, look at the wicks on the candle and the candle bodies. Go to the 30 minute. Go to the
54:59
15-minut. You've got a level of compression into these lows. If this keeps compressing, then
55:06
yeah, we're probably going to roll over lower down. But if we compress and push
55:11
back above, that's going to be the block that needs to hold or your demand zone that needs to hold your triggers above
55:17
here at 59. You're targeting
55:26
63s. Okay. So, understand price action by reading the candles as well. What are
55:32
they showing you? What what is this showing you? These wicks that price not being able to push down. It's been
55:37
absorbed or buyers are stepping into the market. Let's run it
55:43
forward. Very, very choppy. All right. Still nothing clear in terms of context.
55:49
We're not breaking below these lows here, nor are we finding acceptance above 59s.
55:56
And this is the this is the problem when you are looking to execute because it's it's this part of the trade cycle where
56:03
you've done your planning, you've done your prepping, now you've got to execute. Now you've got to now you've got to put your balls on the line and
56:09
execute and pull that trigger. But are your emotions going to make you panic?
56:15
How many times in something like this would you have bought and cut? Bought and
56:20
cut. You buy here, it drops, you cut. You buy here, it drops, you cut. Okay,
56:26
your emotions are taking over. The reason your emotions are taking over because you don't have a clear strategy. You do not have a clear execution
56:32
strategy on how to get on
56:37
board. It's on a 1 hour. But the f the point is on the lower time frame once
56:42
you see acceptance if this is a range once you start pushing above there's your there's your long stop at 57.8 long
56:49
at 59.3 you're targeting these highs. Okay. So the scenario that played out
56:55
was the swing fail scenario because if you go to the 4our chart or even the daily chart, what do you have? You have
57:02
a almost a swing failure of these lows here. We closed outside but we we started getting acceptance back
57:12
inside. And so now let's continue with the replay on the on the 30 minute
57:18
chart. That was a nasty one. Look at that.
57:28
We're still within this range here.
57:33
Okay, that's your mid of the range there. That's your range low. That's your range high. That's your mid.
57:38
Everything in between here and here. If you're not a good day trader, you're going to get chopped
57:44
out. But back above the mid confirms that we're going to go for the highs. back below these lows and
57:50
acceptance and rejection on the underside. We're going lower
57:56
down. But look, look at all this chop and price action between 58 and
58:03
62. And that's just on a 30-inut chart. Let's move it to the 1 hour.
58:11
Okay. So that's why I keep saying if you're going to trade, trade the extremes in in these environments
58:17
because it's here where you've got a lot of aggressive buying and selling occurring. Okay? There's a distribution
58:22
of price. There's a distribution of bitcoins from buyer to seller, seller to
58:32
buyer. Look at all this consolidation. And then we get the move
58:38
up. Then we take out the highs. Great. New alltime highs. Everybody's excited now. Do what? Now, what do we do?
58:44
Exactly what we did at the lows here. Okay, you want to start paying attention now. All right, we're trading above the highs here. What happens now?
58:52
If again, look at the candle bodies. This is on a 1 hour chart. We've broken above 1 2 3 consolidation at the highs
59:00
of 3 hours. And if there's a lot of aggressive buying coming in on the tape,
59:05
market buying, but price can't push up higher, then until that until that
59:11
moment, sellers or passive uh the passive asks in the book are in control here because they're absorbing any
59:18
aggressive buying into this level. And so people are trying to trade the
59:24
breakout. Well, whoever tried to short here, they've puked their positions. You get the pop. But again, if there's
59:29
aggressive buying, you want to see the pullback shortlived. You don't mind a pullback into here, continuation. Let's
59:36
go higher. But the minute you start seeing price coming back into this SR level, back into this range and we start
59:44
seeing this become the supply zone. Well, if this is the range and this we keep rejecting off here and again, then
59:51
you know that this is a level where you might want to be looking to sell. Okay, back under here. You want to be selling
59:57
under here. stop at the high, we could be coming back down into these lows again. Okay? And all that is is just a
1:00:05
range. So, notice I'm not talking about being bullish or being bearish. I'm
1:00:11
talking about levels of execution. What do I need to see to think to myself, [ __ ] we're going to go all the way back
1:00:16
down again. I want to get defensive. I may want to hedge my portfolio. I might want to aggressively I might be a trader
1:00:23
who thinks right I can I can probably make some good money here for a move from 67 down to 58 that's a fairly
1:00:29
decent move even then a move down from 67 down to 63 is a decent trade you know
1:00:35
I can chalk off a decent three three hour trade there short here stop at the highs I'm targeting the mid there you go
1:00:42
boom three trade okay just by looking at this I can tell that I will always yield
1:00:48
a two and a half three hour trade when it comes to trading ranges, right? Let's take it forward. What
1:00:53
happened? Should we do on the 1 hour? Let's go on the 1 hour. In fact, let's go on the 4
1:01:00
hour. The key thing here is what I said was you need to see acceptance above
1:01:06
this 4hour candle. If this is what we had in terms of aggressive market
1:01:13
buying, but we couldn't push higher, this is now going to act as your supply zone. What do we get? We got price
1:01:18
trading above it. Took out the highs. We've got to see acceptance above 68 if
1:01:24
we want to go higher here. Okay. Swing fell sell off puked. Okay.
1:01:33
Whoever built positions in longs have got [ __ ] Anybody who had stops under here, this is what's caused our second
1:01:39
spike down. Cascading liquidations. Where did we trade into?
1:01:44
Straight into the mid. Which context are we in? In a rangebound
1:01:50
environment, we thought we were going to go to new all-time highs and keep going higher. The market tricked us once,
1:01:56
fooled us twice, sold off back into the
1:02:03
mid. So, we've taken liquidity from the lows. We've taken liquidity from the highs. Probability is that we take the
1:02:09
liquidity from the lows. What happens thereafter? You're looking for an underside retest. Sell off.
1:02:16
Okay. Is what is is what I recall what happened. Something along those lines. All right. So, when you look at the
1:02:23
context of what I've just explained and why you've just got to be a little bit
1:02:28
sharp over the coming weeks, okay, you'd have to be um looking to time the tops
1:02:34
or looking to time the bottoms. You just got to understand, all right, if you look at the structure here now on the
1:02:40
daily time frame and you'll see some of the similarities. Now again I just want to
1:02:47
reiterate the point that I made that I'm not using this example to show you oh
1:02:53
guys look you know low IQ we had a fractal that looks very no it's not about that it's about understanding
1:02:59
context understanding where you want to do business what do you need to see to get into the trade what do you need to see to get defensive and any good trader
1:03:06
is always thinking about objectively about any potential downside risk in the
1:03:12
market at any time Okay. And so for me, when you look at price action here,
1:03:18
previous highs stalled above the highs, pulled back into the lows into a good level of demand. Okay. What did price
1:03:25
do? Rally. Took out the highs one more time. Okay. Look at the candle. One,
1:03:31
two, three rejections. Okay. Then we start trading back. The key for me at
1:03:37
this point is this level here because this was our candle body high.
1:03:44
capping price was the deviation. Okay. Resistance, resistance, resistance, thrust above, support, support, support.
1:03:51
If we get back inside here, we're going to trade into this level at 50
1:03:57
57s. Remember this type of context and how you would trade it. Okay, I've gone over the scenarios. Now, when you when
1:04:04
you look at what I've just explained here and you look at the similarities as to what we have
1:04:12
here, okay, two highs, two highs, we had a high, we pulled back, shallow pull
1:04:17
back, another shallow pull back. We're trying to push for those highs again. What do you do now in the instance that
1:04:25
if this is our key SR level, this is our key SR level, you know what you're
1:04:30
looking for. Now when it comes to the potential downside scenario,
1:04:36
okay, in terms of the supply zone, if we just come back to
1:04:43
2021, in terms of the supply zone at the
1:04:51
time on the daily time frame,
1:05:02
Okay, it was this candle here. This up candle was the initial supplies zone and
1:05:07
from where the market rejected from. We couldn't break out. We It was shortlived. So, if you want to see
1:05:15
acceptance, you really want to see price taken off the minute we get above.
1:05:20
We don't want to see price stalling like this. And then the key SR level if if I just get slightly tighter here. Candle
1:05:27
body high SR SRS SR. That's your sign of weakness right there. Okay, this candle
1:05:33
down. You can drop down onto the 1 hour chart. You'll probably see it clearer for yourself. Go ahead at some point do
1:05:42
some back testing. You'll see it there. Okay, I'm not going to search for it now. So in terms of the daily then again
1:05:49
if we're going to go higher, great. We can all celebrate. hurt. If the market's going to take the highs like it did here
1:05:55
and reject, then you've got to be open to the possibility that hang on a minute, we could still be in a larger
1:06:02
rangebound environment. Okay? And so the trend or new prices or higher prices will have to wait. So I'm just covering
1:06:09
the downside scenario. I've covered the upside scenario. You don't want to be shorting this [ __ ] until you have a very
1:06:15
good reason to short this [ __ ] or even hedge out, I should I shouldn't really use the word short, but in terms of
1:06:21
candle bodies again, when you look at price here, we traded above. We've got our
1:06:28
daily supply zone here. What do I need to see for trend continuation higher? I
1:06:33
need to see this SR level. And what I don't want to see is candle uh candle
1:06:45
um a candle do this and then another candle do this and then another one you
1:06:51
know do this but there's no continuation. Instead we got to drop
1:06:59
back inside to this 109 level. Now you've got a decision to make. Okay. Are
1:07:05
you playing defensive with a stop at the high and this is your key pivotal level
1:07:13
here? Okay, because if you get back below here, we're likely to come into this level. Now you've got a problem.
1:07:19
Okay, because now this is that same SR level which
1:07:25
price can't seem to hold. we get back below here, we're going to come I think we
1:07:30
come back down into 97s, potentially back down into 90k
1:07:36
because at that point, as far as I'm concerned, in terms of the range, as I
1:07:43
marked out before, that's my range high. This here is my range low. Okay,
1:07:50
in terms of a higher time frame range, this is the
1:07:56
um the other part of the range. Okay, the other level that I'm focusing
1:08:02
on. So that's what I'm looking at. Okay, that's the risk to the downside if
1:08:09
it sets up. If this is rejection and absorption and exhaustion, exhaustion in terms of price is unable to push higher.
1:08:16
absorption. If there's large aggressive buying volume coming in, which has been absorbed by passive sells, these longs
1:08:25
up here or these fresh longs are probably going to puke. Any longs under here are going to be forced to close out
1:08:30
their trade to take profit. We come back into 106es. All
1:08:41
right. Is that clear? Does that help?
1:08:47
Are you all awake? Have you fallen
1:08:55
asleep? So, three levels that I'm really looking at here. These range
1:09:01
highs, this key SR level here, because you can see where price was being capped. It was being capped. We've
1:09:08
pushed above it. We've got the expansion. Okay. I think we could very well take out these highs.
1:09:15
After that, we'll have to wait and see. Hopefully, we go higher. And if we don't, then we have to accept that
1:09:22
there's a possibility that we're still going to be rangebound
1:09:28
between 90K and 112. Okay, that might be the
1:09:33
range. And if it isn't, then we can probably
1:09:41
celebrate trend continuation higher. So, I've given you the scenario
1:09:48
for continuation. I've given you the scenario that I don't want to be chasing longs here. I've given you a scenario
1:09:55
for a deeper pullback. Okay? We'll have to wait and
1:10:01
see. But the zones that I've I've marked out are relatively clear now in terms of
1:10:06
range high, range low in in relative or in relation to this price action here
1:10:15
and you have a clearly defined mid-range which is coming in there. Okay? Doesn't get any cleaner than that. It really
1:10:22
doesn't. And so for me, it was a blessing in disguise to be able to trade and long this again. Hopefully I can
1:10:27
take the remainder of my profits at that 110.78
1:10:38
level. Any questions? Let's have a look at the 1 hour time frame. Now, when we go to the
1:10:43
1 hour time frame again, it's been a really good move. [Music]
1:10:49
Um, this is the supply zone that we're in where price was being capped
1:10:57
previously. You can see this here. Distribution rounded retest. Okay, I'll
1:11:03
show you what the sort of trick is here. Look at the expansion of this
1:11:09
candle to the downside. Okay, so this was the shifting structure here. This
1:11:14
candle low where price pushed up. This was the high before we pushed lower. But what was key in terms of context was
1:11:22
this swing low here. The minute we see this thrust through this low
1:11:27
here, we're looking for a rounded retest. Okay, so this what what this is essentially what people call a fair
1:11:34
value gap. All right, where we've had a thin move. So what you're looking for is price to come back into this thin move
1:11:40
here. If I just highlight this in pink, that would be your FVG. Okay, fair value gap. I call them inefficiencies. ICT
1:11:48
fanboys call them fair value gaps on a market profile chart. This is what a
1:11:53
bunch of single prints would look like. If I just do it as red and if I extend the line right and if I just say all
1:12:01
right let me take the top of the fair value gap. This is the level where I need to see price reject if we're going
1:12:07
to go lower. If we can find acceptance above this level then we're probably going to go higher. All right. And so
1:12:13
when you look at this, what did we ping? We literally
1:12:18
tagged and filled in the fair value you gap and then we pushed away down into demand. Okay, I've never watched
1:12:26
ICT probably one video for 10 minutes, but from everything that I've gauged and
1:12:31
understand or understood for all the ICT fanboys, that's your fair value gap
1:12:37
trade. And then equally on the downside, oh look, fair value gap into a demand zone. To me, it's just a [ __ ] demand
1:12:42
zone and it's a thin move. Yes, you're going to get price rip through this level and you're going to see a reaction ideally from this demand zone because
1:12:49
again, the key thing here is look at this high just like we did
1:12:56
here. Look at this low and look at the thrust through it. So again, look at this um high and then look at the thrust
1:13:01
through it. Through any test back, any test back of this level, ideally you
1:13:07
want to see a reaction. But if we trade through that level and hold and go down, then it's [ __ ]
1:13:15
essentially. All right. So, fresh test of supply, fresh test of demand, fair
1:13:21
value gap, fair value gap, market inefficiency, market inefficiency, single prints, whatever the [ __ ] you
1:13:26
want to call it.
1:13:39
And so here we are back at that same level. This is why I've taken profit um
1:13:44
or had limits which have filled. We're into resistance. Okay. Next question
1:13:50
is where support on the lower time frames for me? It's this level here.
1:13:56
This is going to be a massive level. Keep an eye out on the
1:14:01
106 to 105.8. That's the zone now that I'm
1:14:06
watching for a potential pullback. All right? Because if you think about it, if
1:14:12
I just clear the chart again, in fact, I'm not going to clear clear the chart. I'm going to leave
1:14:19
everything. Just clear these up.
1:14:27
You've got your range low, you've got your range high, we've got our
1:14:35
mid. It's essentially
1:14:50
here. There we go. Okay. Because when you just look at price from a value
1:14:55
perspective, okay, in terms of value, if that's your range high, that's your range low, where is 80% of of of of time
1:15:03
being spent in the chart. It's not the extremes, is generally in the middle where the chop is. All right. The
1:15:08
extremities are for reversion back into the mid range low back into the mid. Okay? Back into the mean of where the
1:15:15
majority or or the 80% of the time where price is spent. But the 20% is where prices have been
1:15:22
shortlived and it reversed back into the mean. And so when you look at when you
1:15:28
look at um Bitcoin here, what do we have? We've got a very nice rangebound
1:15:37
area. Okay, where the majority of the price action has been in this zone here. Again, when you look at the extremity,
1:15:44
that's an extremity outside 80% of the range. Okay, that's your 80%
1:15:53
20% and 20% here. Okay. Fade low, low
1:15:58
back to the um highs. Okay. Highs back to the value area low and so forth until
1:16:05
you see a shallow pullback. Okay. So, price breaks up, shallow pullback back above. Now, you can start thinking
1:16:10
about, all right, we're getting a shift of value outside of here. If we can start pushing up, we're going to break
1:16:16
out. Okay. So in terms of a range of this whole area there you are okay this
1:16:23
is one rangebound area this is the other rangebound area
1:16:28
and and for me what I was looking for was 109 when I said I believe I suspect the range that we're going to get is
1:16:34
between 100 to 109 and this is why this origin here was the origin of the
1:16:40
underside rejection into a selloff okay this this is the immediate range that
1:16:46
we're So had we rejected from here, I was looking to buy 103s again. Okay, I
1:16:52
would have got stopped out on my long under here because why? Market structure breaking market structure. Okay, if it's
1:16:59
if it's not shortlived and go higher, then it brings 103s into play. The fact
1:17:05
is that we are now pushing up into the upper bound of the range. Okay. So again when we think about value areas well we
1:17:11
don't have as much data up here as we have had done have had down here and so
1:17:16
again if this is the extreme 20% and this is the lower bound of the 20% if you look at where the majority of price
1:17:23
has been spent have spent in the past it's all in this region here. So if there are selling opportunities here if
1:17:29
there's any buying opportun opportunities it's going to be here. Okay. And I'd much rather look for buying opportunities than try and be in
1:17:36
a be a hero and step into the front side of this trade here. That's not what I
1:17:41
want to do. I don't really want to be stepping into the front side of this. The only way I'm going to step in front of this is if I see some form of
1:17:49
distribution, another pop gets back inside. I'm thinking to myself, right,
1:17:54
short 110, stop at there, come back into here, trade done, start looking for longs. If this fails, [ __ ] it. Stop at
1:18:01
the high, underside rejection, short down into the lows again. Okay, and we're playing that entire
1:18:09
range. That's all there is to
1:18:16
it. Let's move on to Ethereum. Um,
1:18:21
ETHUSDT looks very decent now. Again, we're just into that resistance level.
1:18:27
So again, one, two, three. Are we going to get another push up? Four. And then
1:18:35
what do we do if it rejects? Then what? Okay, if this rejects, then essentially for bullish
1:18:42
continuation or well trend continuation higher. Let's just assume we we we we
1:18:47
reject here. We get a pullback. You want it to be a shallow pullback consolidation. Then we can say, right,
1:18:53
all this was reconsolidation. we get this shallow pull back just like
1:18:58
on Bitcoin uh as I showed you in the November November 24 example and we
1:19:04
start breaking up you should see this low hold you're going for these highs and taking these out when you zoom out
1:19:12
it becomes very very clear okay so I'm not sure which way Ethereum is going
1:19:18
to go because if you look at the higher time frame we are into a massive level here so the key is very simple I think
1:19:26
acceptance Acceptance above this level here we should not [ __ ] about. Okay. I
1:19:33
think acceptance above here I think look just like just like you just seen on Bitcoin.
1:19:41
Okay. All this move down here in my
1:19:46
opinion is really weak resistance. So we
1:19:52
had the consolidation and then we saw the continuation. Now we're getting the inverse. Look at this. All this thin
1:19:59
inefficiency was easy to trade through. Look how price just glides into this level. Now we've got a level of
1:20:05
resistance. Okay, so this is all resistance. If we can get above here,
1:20:10
we're going to fill this in very very quickly in my opinion. And I would be looking
1:20:17
for 3,400 3,500 potentially with the stop at the
1:20:22
low. If if there's a a run of these highs and we get a shallow pullback, okay, taking the mid of this range,
1:20:28
range low, range high, mid-range, you can buy the pullback as long as this mid-range holds long. Hopefully, it
1:20:34
flips resistance. If it does, there's really not much in the path until around
1:20:40
about 33 3,400. If we break down, I'm buying 21s. Okay?
1:20:48
Because resistance, resistance, resistance, resistance, SR.
1:20:54
Okay? Resistance, consolidation, sold off, reclaim. If there is a pullback,
1:20:59
that's the pullback to buy. If there's a shallow pullback and you're looking for the breakout trade higher, I've just
1:21:04
covered that scenario here. I'm not going to map it out in detail, but I've given you kind of the context that you're looking for. And much of this
1:21:11
really depends on what Bitcoin does. Okay, is that
1:21:21
clear? The problem that I've got on altcoins is, and I'll go over it in a
1:21:28
second. Let me just look at the moving averages on Ethereum. The daily looks fine. Okay, we compress, but we've
1:21:34
pushed above it. So, that tells me, all right, fine. As long as these lows hold,
1:21:40
you know, you could start chasing this. But the minute you you get below the bands,
1:21:47
well, I think we we we probably trade into this level
1:21:54
here on the 3-day. Looks good. On the weekly, looks
1:22:01
good. It It really looks fine to me in all honesty. It's looking a lot better
1:22:06
than it did a few weeks ago. So again, when I look at the weekly here, what the key thing for me is this here.
1:22:15
Look, look at these rejections in terms of price. But why are we not
1:22:21
seeing expansion to the downside? Why the [ __ ] are we still compressing under
1:22:26
resistance? So is this distribution or is this consolidation
1:22:31
before we see a move higher? Now what gives me confidence again if you look at
1:22:37
the weekly moving averages here we are seeing
1:22:42
almost a form of compression. We're almost there guys. Okay in terms of just
1:22:48
like we saw continuation higher here just like we saw consolidation continuation high here.
1:22:54
Look at the consolidation here in 2024. We're back at those levels again.
1:23:01
So either we're going to be rangebound for the
1:23:06
summer or we get the breakout in the coming weeks into July. Okay. Remains to be
1:23:13
seen. So for me bias or contextual bias nothing clear yet but it looks
1:23:20
encouraging is what I want to say from a weekly time frame where I would get cause for cons
1:23:27
not cause for concern but where I have to accept that okay [ __ ] this is going to go lower I have to be a buyer lower
1:23:33
down is essentially price coming into this
1:23:39
level here okay below the bands then uh you've got to be open to the possibility of
1:23:48
21s. Let's look at
1:23:55
Salana. It gave me the pullback that I wanted. Okay. Into that 140 level. That's the level that I I wanted in
1:24:02
terms of the pullback. This
1:24:10
here, we've got that. We've we've got a decent reaction. Now the the thing is
1:24:16
right if Bitcoin let's just assume Bitcoin gives a correction. Let's let's just assume it goes from 110 111 112
1:24:24
back to 106es. I think then in that case if that happens okay again just using
1:24:30
the simple concepts of a range that's my range low. This above here is my range highs.
1:24:37
So where's the mid? We've got a very clear mid level which is which could act as resistance, right? And that comes in
1:24:44
very nicely at this KSR level
1:24:51
here. So you can see that Bitcoin is coming to resistance, Ethereum is coming
1:24:56
to resistance, Salana is coming into resistance. The question I'm asking
1:25:02
myself is, all right, fine. There's two scenarios that I'm looking at here. I'm
1:25:07
not sure I want to short any rejections off here. I'd much rather wait
1:25:15
for this. Okay, give me a rounded retest. And I think we're long to 180s,
1:25:22
potentially 200s because in terms of price
1:25:28
action, we've sold off. Okay, this is where you want to or
1:25:34
should have been bearish. We we have now pushed up for the first time. We've got consolidation,
1:25:41
expansion, deeper correction. If we're going to be bullish, then
1:25:47
this rejection has to hold. If we do get a rejection, you want to see a higher
1:25:52
low or a swing fail. Okay? And then you can say, "Right, we're going to go for these highs here." when you zoom out of
1:25:58
of everything. So if I just keep it very simple from a higher time frame
1:26:11
perspective, if I go to the daily and Salana, I
1:26:17
think in terms of rangebound price action, these highs here, that's what I'd be looking for.
1:26:24
Okay. And in terms of extreme lows, well, you're looking at this
1:26:33
here. And so for me, it it's not alt season as such, okay? It's just trading
1:26:39
price action. There's opportunities to long. There will be opportunities to short at the extremes. If I see Salana
1:26:47
give me a pullback lower down, then the whole concept of value
1:26:53
comes into play. If this is our 80% of the price action where we see the extreme down
1:27:00
here or the extreme above here, I'm a seller above here. I'm a buyer up here
1:27:06
looking to trade price back up into these highs. I'm a seller up here looking to trade price well to the mid
1:27:12
at least then back down. Okay, but intra intra price action within this range.
1:27:18
I've clearly stated that look if we get resistancy and there's a pullback I'm longing this back into 160s potentially
1:27:24
back into 180s again. Okay. So what I've just showed you there's a range within a range
1:27:30
essentially. This is not an alt season. Okay. It's just rotational price action.
1:27:36
Whichever way you look at it, this is an alt season
1:27:42
here. Whether this is going to pull back, that's an alt season there. Okay,
1:27:47
this here and all this [ __ ] here is not an alt season or an alt cycle. It's just
1:27:53
very good trading opportunities to play the rotations back and forth. Mean
1:27:59
reversions, rotations, oscillations, call them whatever you want. Rangebound, price action at its finest. All
1:28:09
right. Right. Any last questions because I want to call it a wrap. I want to hop off stream soon. I've been on here for
1:28:15
the best part of an hour and a half, but hopefully I've given you enough food for thoughts, ways to really think about
1:28:22
price action here. Um, ways to, you know, be optimistic about higher prices,
1:28:29
but also remaining cognizant of when to essentially uh think about becoming
1:28:36
defensive as well. All
1:28:41
right, keep your emotions calm if we start seeing new alltime highs because
1:28:47
if it's shortlived and we get we drop back inside then there's a real possibility that we could oscillate back
1:28:54
towards 90k. All right, that's all I'm saying. Just
1:28:59
remain levelheaded. [ __ ] the timeline. Forget what people are saying. Just remain levelheaded. It's your money. it's your
1:29:06
capital. The first thing you want to be thinking about is preservation and draw down management. Do that well and you'll
1:29:13
have a very good career in trading. All right, one last chart. ENA.
1:29:21
Yes, because I'm buying ENA. I've been buying ENA. I've been dollar cost averaging in. I think it's a very nice
1:29:26
chart. Now, this is one of those charts if you're expecting me to say to you guys, buying ENA, I think we're going to
1:29:32
get an alt season next week. No, [ __ ] off straight away. That's all I'm going to say. Um, if you've got patience like
1:29:38
I am and your dollar cost averaging into a play like this and you're ready that
1:29:43
if [ __ ] hits the fan and this goes to 20 cents, you know, you're not going to be,
1:29:49
oh yeah, Exo shield this [ __ ] coin and it's tanked 50% in a day, if the
1:29:54
market's going to drop, the market's going to drop. Now, for me, my plan is very simple. I've been a buyer at these lows.
1:30:00
I will continue buying out these lows and by no means am I endorsed or paid or
1:30:05
you know whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it have I been told to talk about Athena for me the scenario is very
1:30:12
simple if you look at a circle right listing at silly valuations and if you
1:30:18
believe that look stable coins are here to stay and you've got companies who are
1:30:24
you know listing on the sock exchange you've got circle right listing on the
1:30:29
sock exchange at a high valuation. Then what does that mean for the broader market in terms of those projects that
1:30:36
are highly correlated or built upon the premise of
1:30:43
or you know you know the the fundamentals of stable stable coins. Okay. So for me when you look at Ave
1:30:49
when you look at curve when you look at Ethereum and if Ethereum takes off then I think Ethereum serves as a fantastic
1:30:56
beta play to Ethereum. And so for me, I've been I've been in all honesty, I've been buying out 30 cents, 29 cents.
1:31:03
That's where I've been doing my business. I now have 50% allocated. When I say 50% allocated, I'm not talking
1:31:09
about 50% of my net worth is in Athena. I've allocated 50% of my total
1:31:16
allocation for what I wanted to pick up or purchase in terms of Athena. I've been slowly chipping away at these lows
1:31:23
here. Okay. The other 50% that I wish to buy is either going to come lower down
1:31:31
here, right? For whatever reason, you never know when the market's going to sell off or I start trend ch if we start
1:31:39
pushing above this above these highs and we get into a trend, I'm going to pile
1:31:44
in here. Okay. So if my average cost price is 30 cents right now and price
1:31:50
let's just say worst case scenario price drops into 20 cents then my average basis is going to
1:31:56
be 25 cents but I'm not going to buy if it's dropping down I'm going to buy once it gives me a reclaim of this level here
1:32:02
then fine I'll start buying at 20 cents I'll bought in at 30 I'll buy at 20 it gives me a dollar cost basis of 25 if
1:32:08
I'm buying at 30s I'm buying at 45s that then gives me around about a
1:32:14
dollar cost average price of 37 cents which is around here. So I'm still within this range and and and my average
1:32:21
is either going to be at the mean of the range or it's going to be at the lower bound of the range but I know from an
1:32:26
asymmetric point of view as long as this project doesn't go to [ __ ] fundamentally well guess what look at the asymmetric
1:32:32
return to the upside. So for me when I when I see these big random bottoms this is
1:32:40
opportunity. Okay this is the [ __ ] that I live for when it comes to buying altcoins. This to me is if you want to
1:32:46
buy into altcoins looking for those 3, four, 5xs on on projects that have got very good fundamentals and this is one
1:32:53
of them that fits that description for me very nicely. And then when you look at the moving
1:32:59
averages, the daily, I didn't have any reason to buy this [ __ ] until I saw this
1:33:06
first period of green. Okay, sorry. This first period of green
1:33:12
here. When I saw this and price pulling down, look at the compression of the bands on the
1:33:17
daily. Look at the velocity and the trajectory and then look at the the momentum, the seller
1:33:24
momentum slowing down. Look at the candle bodies at the lows here. This is what you want to see in terms of seller
1:33:31
exhaustion. Okay, then we get a rounded retest of those lows just like we did here. Look at the seller exhaustion.
1:33:38
Small body candles. Okay, then we flip showing a sign of strength retest. Look
1:33:46
at the shift in trend. So the key for me here and like I've explained previously
1:33:51
is that when you start seeing a shift in momentum, if you look at price action
1:33:57
here where look at this period of red and then we get a shallow period of green,
1:34:04
this isn't a reason to buy because it's very shortlived. Price is in a range. It's chopping up the bands. We break
1:34:10
down, sell off lower. Still no reason to buy. Oh, look a period of green. But the key thing is look at the period of red
1:34:18
relative to the period of green. The red is far extensive. The green periods are very short. When you want to recognize
1:34:25
strength, you need to see this flip where the the selling momentum or the red momentum because of the crossovers
1:34:31
becomes very shallow and the green momentum for the first time
1:34:37
exceeds the reliveness of selling here shortlived. And not only that, you get a
1:34:43
shift in structure. Now you know it's time to buy Athena. So, if you followed me last year, you will have noticed that
1:34:50
I was very aggressive on buying Athena at that 23, 24, 25 cents level. Where
1:34:55
did I sell it? I sold it at a dollar. Okay? Cuz then you've got the shift in trend. You're going for these highs. It
1:35:01
traded $130. I got out at $1. That was enough for me. That was a nice four and a halfx multiplier. I'm looking for the
1:35:08
same again. When you look at price action here, right, anybody who's been
1:35:13
chilling Athena, all this [ __ ] okay, pain, we've get a a
1:35:21
small period of green, but we're still within a range. There's nothing really to do here. Now, we finally drop into
1:35:28
the lows. Now, I'm interested. Okay, because for the first time, we have a
1:35:33
longer period of green, a very short period of red into this range low here.
1:35:40
Now we've we've flipped green. Look at the green phase in relation to the
1:35:46
previous red phase. If this is now going to become bullish over the next 2 3 months, any pullbacks into here are for
1:35:54
buying. Okay, as far as I'm concerned, then once we get that shift in market
1:35:59
structure, higher high, these bands will become green
1:36:04
because look at the compression of the bands. This is on the 12-hour on the daily. Again, this this kind of
1:36:11
summarizes what I've just been saying. For the first time, we are seeing a nice
1:36:16
period of green. If this red period is shortlived and we flip green again, we're going to get a break in structure.
1:36:23
We want to see a higher low consolidation and then we're off to the races again. Okay, that's what I think
1:36:28
will happen. And my time horizon for something like this is 6 months. Okay,
1:36:33
if this doesn't happen in the next six to nine months, then I don't know what what's what's what's going to happen in that case
1:36:41
because my thesis is wrong. I [ __ ] up on the trade. Well, I haven't [ __ ] up on the trade. The trade never worked out
1:36:46
essentially. Okay. But I would take this trade nine times out of 10 if it's going
1:36:51
to set up to become a very good trade. The problem is most of you don't have the patience to to sit through the
1:36:59
accumulation aspects. If you want those big returns, then you've got to start building positions or finding a way to
1:37:05
build positions. Don't start chasing Athena when it's somewhere up here because then you're [ __ ] yourself
1:37:11
because now you might get 90 cents to double your money. It's got to go to 180
1:37:16
and then you got the r this downside risk of like what if it stalls out here and it comes all the way back down to 20
1:37:23
cents. You bought at 90, are you going to capitulate at the lows? So asymmetric
1:37:28
opportunities often comes at these lows if if this is a very good opportunity to
1:37:34
buy. So that's a decision that you've got to make. I can't make that decision for you. If you think altcoins are going
1:37:40
to go lower, then that's all new. If you think altcoins are going to go higher, that's also new. It's not on me. I'm
1:37:45
just explaining why and how I'm looking to position into something like Athena and why I've been picking it up. again,
1:37:52
not being paid, not endorsed, no association with the project, never spoken to them. So that's all I can tell
1:37:58
you here. Okay? And I and I hope I really hope that for whatever reason
1:38:03
markets do fall off a cliff in in August, September, and that we do get a a real shakeout or selling event into
1:38:11
this back above. That for me is brilliant. I'd love to buy this and load up cuz then my dollar cost average
1:38:18
becomes 21, 22, 23, 24, 5 cents. I'm buying the literal lows here in the view
1:38:24
that I think we we trade these highs. That is what I would load up on
1:38:32
in the view that I can pull a very comfortable four 5x maybe more. Okay?
1:38:37
And if it doesn't, then fine. I'm wrong on the trade. I own the losses like a man. I'm not going to [ __ ] about it.
1:38:52
Okay, does that make
1:39:00
sense? So the key thing with Bitcoin here is if you look at this market profile, we had a naked point of control
1:39:10
here. This was the value area high from the uh the high on the 22nd of May. So
1:39:17
this was the all-time high here. We opened
1:39:23
at 111.5s, traded above. The minute we got
1:39:29
below the value area high, you can see we you'll see this on this chart here.
1:39:36
So there's your Pshape distribution. Okay. The minute we for found acceptance
1:39:43
below, that's your value area. This is what was capping price to the upside.
1:39:48
That became your resistance val value area low. Next day
1:39:55
value area high. You've got your naked point of control here as well. There's a naked point of control at
1:40:05
111s or I think it is. Um yeah it is. And so you can see where
1:40:12
we rejected from previously. This was your [ __ ] Let me do that
1:40:21
better. I'll do that in pink. This was your This was your um resistance. This V
1:40:26
value area low. Next day's value area high. That's where price is finding
1:40:32
acceptance back below that level. There's your resistance.
1:40:37
Okay. And then what did we do? We
1:40:43
traded into a bunch of single prints
1:40:53
here, right? When you think about fair value gaps and inefficiencies on a
1:40:58
market profile chart, it's where you've got these single prints, just one single TPO block. Okay, one of these is called
1:41:05
a TPO time, price, opportunity. Each block generally represents 30 minutes.
1:41:11
When you look at this TPO here and again this is another reason why I was looking to long this level.
1:41:18
Okay, from the top of the TPO which was at round about
1:41:24
103s 102s 101's all the way down to
1:41:30
100 and the bottom of the TPO was at 99.9. So call it 100. When you look
1:41:35
across the line, we took out all the
1:41:51
lows. There we go. We tagged it on that day there. Okay. last week. Can you see
1:41:56
that we came into 10 and 100 right at the low 100s, but we
1:42:02
tagged almost tagged and found a reaction from the single prints taking out all the previous
1:42:09
lows. And now we've we're gravitating back towards that same area. And look at
1:42:16
where we've rejected from today with the this was a naked point of
1:42:23
control because reason we say naked because it hadn't traded this point of
1:42:29
control on the way down. Okay, it became a naked point of control and so I marked
1:42:34
this out and today we've traded through that level and we've rejected from where
1:42:41
that same supply zone. Okay, that we rejected from here and
1:42:48
here. And that's that for me is the reason why I I've taken profit on the longs. Okay, or on most of my longs, I
1:42:55
should say. So, that's a very quick um insight
1:43:00
into the market profile chart. And there is still a naked point of control
1:43:07
at 111 11.2 as well. So just something to
1:43:13
watch out for if we do get another push up, whether this level here becomes a
1:43:19
point of rejection and then whether we find some sort of oscillation back down into again. Here's the other nice aspect
1:43:26
of this. If you look at the previous price action, can you see these
1:43:31
profiles? Each one of these is a daily profile, right? Value area low, value
1:43:37
area high. This is where the majority of the time price is spent, okay? For that given day, the next day, and then the
1:43:43
day after, and then the day after. So, what have you noticed that price? If you really think about it, if you look at
1:43:49
all the value area highs, there's one here, there's one there, there's one there, there's one here, there's one here. This in itself, it's kind of like
1:43:57
the range highs where you've got the deviation above the highs. And then equally in terms of the value area lows,
1:44:04
value area low, you've got two here, you've got one there, you've got one there. So you've kind of got a a median
1:44:10
point of this being your value area low. And so what you can do
1:44:17
is if I take it back to this day here before we had this expansion, let's just take one, two,
1:44:24
three, four, five, six, seven days of price action, right? You can merge the profile into a composite.
1:44:35
merge with the previous profile. These two days combined
1:44:40
together. Now merge this with this here and so
1:44:47
forth until you have a a 7-day composite. And then
1:44:53
again, because you've got price action contained within a range, you can create a composite which
1:45:00
tells you where the value area high of this entire composite is and the value area low.
1:45:15
And so what you find is that the value area low is at 104.2 and the value area
1:45:22
high is at 1.58. If we find acceptance below here,
1:45:27
we're going to trade into the single prints. That's essentially what I had. All right. on my um chart during the
1:45:33
week last week I should say I said that if we find acceptance below valuary low
1:45:39
we will probably take out the poor highs and then look for the single prince which I called SPS okay that's what we
1:45:45
did the minute we get above 105.8 8, you're looking for
1:45:51
expansion to the upside now. Okay? Because all this range where price has
1:45:56
deviated the lows, well, we've we've taken the liquidity from the lows. We should be now pushing to the highs. So,
1:46:02
if you look at this very clean expansion to the highs, that's our value area high
1:46:08
here where we deviated resistance, resistance. We tried to push above it, but look at that expansion. Okay, this
1:46:15
is a distribution day or a trend day essentially. And where have we tagged the previous
1:46:21
point from where the market sold off before it found a level of balanced a
1:46:26
balanced bracketed environment here. Okay, so that's a a very
1:46:34
quick probably um bastardized version
1:46:40
of market profiles, but I've tried to simplify in a way without making it sound [ __ ] complicated because it
1:46:46
isn't. But I've tried to simplify it in a way which hopefully makes some sense to you guys. And then if you want to
1:46:52
reset the profiles, you just say reset all merges and splits. And when it does it, there you
1:47:00
go. Okay. And if you want to know what my settings are, then fine. You can have my settings as
1:47:05
well. Um settings. There you
1:47:11
go. All right. Block size 30 minutes. Row size manual. Ticks per row. value
1:47:16
area 70. You can have the value area as 80 if you want. I prefer 70.
1:47:22
Um there's my gradient colors. Opacity. See that opacity outside value
1:47:29
areas. Okay, you can see that there. Um you've got point of control.
1:47:36
So if you want to display the point of control, the orange lines. Okay. If you want to display poor highs and poor
1:47:41
lows, if I just say, okay, let me do one in pink. then it should mark out the
1:47:47
pool lows. There you go. Okay, see that there? It marked out the uh pool lows
1:47:53
for me there. Okay, just to prove a point if I do that in a I don't know. Let's do it in yellow. There you go. You
1:48:00
can see it'll even highlight where there's some pool. So, you don't have to look at the chart and think, "Yeah, [ __ ] Where's the next pool? Oh, I can't
1:48:06
find it." It'll mark it out for you this way so you know what you're really looking for. Essentially, unfinished
1:48:11
auctions. Okay, that's what it is. Um, what
1:48:23
else? What else? What else? What else? Remove that. Value area high.
1:48:29
Value area low. I've got the open marked. Okay. You'll see this one. Do you select that on the chart? Value area
1:48:36
high. Value area low. um initial balance
1:48:41
range, IB range, two two profiles. Okay, the first hour of Bitcoin generally
1:48:48
forms the initial balance range or the opening range and then show volume
1:48:54
profile. That's for the volume aspect. I think that's it. Everything
1:48:59
else I've got switched off. All right, guys. I think that's it. Hopefully you all have a fab week ahead and uh best of
1:49:07
luck with your trading for the remainder of June. Catch you on the next stream in
1:49:14
July. Have a good time. Take care. God bless. Bye-bye.
