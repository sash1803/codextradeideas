All
0:22
right, people. We should be live. If you can just give me a quick confirmation in the chat that you can hear me, okay, and
0:28
you can see my screen.
0:34
All
0:50
right. Volume is good. Yeah. All right. Fantastic. How is everybody?
0:55
Good to be back for a July stream. The last one I do did was back in uh June. I
1:01
generally now try to do these once a month. I I know I used to stream quite frequently in the past, but um as many
1:09
of you know, I've been running the charity mentorship and uh in the process been moving house, traveling, spending
1:17
time with family, but trading as well. But it's good to see some of the regulars here. Special thank you to you
1:24
all for tuning in. And as always in uh today's stream, anything said is not financial advice. It's just my view of
1:31
the market. It's generally more for educational purposes.
1:37
And something that I always try to do on these streams is it's not really um you
1:43
you know talk about essentially do I think Bitcoin is going to go to 150
1:48
or 200K. I absolutely do think it will do that you know at some point in the future. Uh, you know, my streams have
1:55
always been geared towards those who are learning to trade and want to embark
2:00
upon that journey of becoming a trader. And as I said in the past, I always try to give back something that something of
2:08
the nature that I wish I had when I first started without really going into the intricacies of order flow, you know,
2:14
footprints, market profile, just really looking at markets from a price action first perspective and then we can talk
2:21
about the other tools at a later point in time. But a special thank you to my
2:26
partners, Prime XPTt, for once again sponsoring the live streams. Don't
2:32
forget with uh Prime there's a special promotion going off which is uh you can
2:37
now trade on their platform throughout July and August for significantly
2:42
reduced fees. Okay. So most crypto exchanges I believe charge anywhere between 0.05 to 0.04 0.04%
2:51
in terms of make a taker fees. U with prime you're looking to pay around about
2:56
0.015% you get access to VIP 2. uh there's no certain volume required. I know with a
3:03
lot u with well with many exchanges you have to hit certain volume thresholds to
3:09
get to these lower rates. I think for prime uh they're certainly just
3:14
promoting this to allow you to trade digital currencies. I also believe um
3:20
forex market CFDs and whatnot. Okay. I think for those of you who are um when
3:27
you look at trading I mean I mean I just want to touch upon this I didn't know this until recently having spoken to the
3:32
prime team but for those of you who are looking to trade CFDs on Prime uh you
3:39
can get swap free accounts. I will have further details about that because that's fairly substantial, especially
3:45
those of you who, you know, want to trade CFDs, but you're always worried about the the interest rate nature of
3:54
trading. So, it's it's certainly going to be more appealing to those um you know, for whatever religious reasons uh
4:00
different people have. All right, so let's just kick off the stream then. I think um now that we've done that, we
4:05
can certainly proceed ahead. We'll start off with a blank chart. Okay, new month, new start, second half of the year.
4:16
So, we'll have a look at Bitcoin. I think today's market stream I I don't really want to drag this out than any
4:22
longer than it has to be. I want to just keep it straight, short, to the point, and I will probably jump on stream again
4:28
in two weeks time as a continuation. Um, but let's just start off on the weekly time frame. In fact, we can have a look
4:33
at the monthly time frame. Again, when we look at the monthly chart, I think what's key for me and something that I
4:38
alluded to in the past is generally we'll start off with the basics. So, when I look at the Bitcoin chart on a
4:44
monthly perspective here, let me just get my
4:50
pen open. Thank you, Bantill, for the uh kind
4:55
compliment with regards to the charity mentorship. Hopefully, the the best is yet to come over the next two three weeks. So,
5:02
anybody who's looking up to sign up to the charity mentorship, please do not sign up right now because I will be
5:07
ending the uh the mentorship in the next 3 to four weeks, possibly at some point in August. But um depending on how or
5:16
what my availability is like, I may run an additional mentorship throughout the second half of the year as a
5:22
continuation of the first mentorship which is going to be covering slightly more advanced concepts when it
5:28
comes to orderflow trading and trading uh trades, how to get connected, how to trade on
5:34
those markets. So that's something that I may be looking to do, but it just depends on my own circumstances. But
5:41
anyway, looking at the chart here on the monthly time frame, okay, wicks at the highs, wicks at the
5:47
lows, these are key inflection points on the market, whichever way you look at it. Okay, there's always been a
5:53
substantial reaction from these points in the market. So, what I again I'm I'm
5:59
I'm just considering the fact or the possibility that look,
6:04
could there be a possibility or a scenario that we could break up higher? Yes, absolutely. Right. you you can't
6:10
know for certain that we are going to reject from here. But again, the first thing that comes to my mind is the fact
6:16
that majority of this price action has been rangebound. And really, we need to see initiative price action above these
6:24
highs above 112 113 on high volume that isn't going to get
6:29
absorbed by passive sellers. Okay? So in the books you will see well whether you
6:36
see passive sales stacked in the books or not is irrelevant. Okay that's why heat maps are not always reliable
6:42
because a heat map is just essentially an advertisement of passive players who are looking to get their positions
6:48
filled. But sometimes what you have to remember is that if you're a large player you're not essentially going to
6:53
advertise a really large order in the book and so that other participants may start front ring those orders. Okay. And
7:00
that's where the concept of iceberg orders comes into play. And you won't necessarily see that happen on a on a on
7:07
a candlestick chart. You have to look at the dome. You have to look at the footprints. You will see those passive
7:13
orders, right? Get into these will get filled and then the the the the asks
7:19
will get replenished and then there's another $50 million worth of asks resting in the books. Meanwhile, you've
7:25
got all this aggressive buying happening here, market buying. Okay? Whether it's a combination of shorts closing out
7:32
their positions because they've been stopped so therefore they become forced buyers or whether it's new participants
7:38
or you know late participants looking to trade the breakout essentially just filling a large entity's asks here. And
7:46
then the the scenario that you then have to look for is that if we get acceptance back inside these set of highs where for
7:54
whatever reason we can't seem to get a a an aggressive thrust higher on high
8:00
volume. So you should see a spike in volume and if you see a thrust through this level then I would say there's a
8:06
good possibility that we we see a breakout trade in terms of continuation. If you see
8:13
a candle pushing up into this uh level here, let me just clean up the chart. If
8:19
you see a candle pushing up into this level, okay, and the volume spike is
8:25
fairly reasonable, it's fairly aggressive and you're watching the tape and you see orders flow into the books,
8:31
but there's no continuation, that's a lot of effort for not much reward. Okay? And therefore, it starts raising doubts.
8:39
By no means will you understand during this phase whether we are going to see
8:45
continuation or rejection but you certainly can look for signs of absorption or exhaustion. Okay. And then
8:51
if you find acceptance back inside well all those traders are trapped in there they'll puke their positions and then
8:56
you get the reversion potentially to you know somewhere wherever relevant sport
9:02
is found again. Okay. So that's just a concept of something that you've got to watch out for. And one thing that I
9:08
don't like um again is the fact that when I drop into the weekly chart here
9:15
um you know if you look at the price action here just from a candle perspective on the highs we've got this
9:23
high here. Okay. We've also got in terms of weekly candle closes
9:29
resistance. Okay. So let's just go left to right. Okay. Or right to left whichever resistance. We never close
9:34
inside. Okay. Same again. Same again and again and again and again and again. Okay, how many more times is it going to
9:41
take before we can hopefully at some point trade through this level?
9:48
Not only just trade through this but on high volume shallow pullback and you see
9:53
continuation higher, then I would be happy to go with the breakout long and and look for that continuation. Unless
9:59
we see a a real aggressive drive in momentum and tape and I'm watching the order flow and I think right it's time
10:05
to get on board with this trade because my invalidation is clear. My invalidation is that if this starts pushing away then I know if we get back
10:12
inside here it's probably a fake break. They're getting trapped and I have to cut my position and reverse and look for
10:19
the short on the other side. Okay, that's kind of the the highle concepts of how I would personally be looking to
10:24
trade those types of plays. So
10:30
looking at this you can see immediately from a weekly stand from a weekly time frame where key resistance is it is at
10:37
that 109k level and in through here it's it's fairly congested. It's fairly
10:42
choppy. It's the sentiment has been very very bullish. Every every time we trade into 110s we find rejection and then the
10:50
sentiment flips a week later once we're trading back down into 101's and 98s and
10:55
105s. It's doom and gloom. So, you've got to really put the sentiment aside
11:01
and just focus on price action or what price is telling you. So, when I look at this level here,
11:06
we've got this on the daily time frame, we have this daily supply zone or daily breaker or daily
11:13
resistance, whichever terminology you like to use, it's all the same to me.
11:19
But ultimately when I look at a price here you can see along this level again we
11:26
didn't find any acceptance previously which has become a level of resistance. We traded okay above this high here on a
11:34
daily premise. Okay when you look at this green line on this daily chart we had one candle close above it and we
11:41
traded back through that level again and every time thereafter has been a rejection. There's been no clear signs
11:47
of acceptance above here. So again for me this now using this high here is is
11:53
going to act as an important level to have mapped out on the chart. Now taking
12:00
taking into consideration uh recency we can also just use these highs here.
12:06
Okay. So somewhere in this zone is if I see a rejection
12:13
of where price tries to push up but it gets rejected. That for me warrants caution that we could see a rotation
12:20
back down. How far down I do not know. Okay. I'm not here I'm not in this game to predict. I'm here to react to what
12:28
the chart is telling me. What the order flow is telling me and where I can look to step in. But the main purpose of the
12:35
chart is is a compass for me. Okay? It helps me identify levels that I'm
12:42
looking to trade. But it doesn't show me where I want to execute. That's where the lower time frame order flow dynamics
12:50
or 5 minute time frames, one minute time frames. Maybe you want to look at the DOM, maybe you want to look at the tape,
12:56
maybe you want to look at heat maps. whatever it is, whatever your execution method is, it helps you refine exactly
13:02
the level that you want to do business at. Okay, so that's kind of my thoughts here on the higher time frame. When I
13:07
look at this structure here, we are spending a considerable amount of time.
13:12
Um, and there has been evidently a level of spot selling every time we approach
13:19
these highs whilst futures are trying to bid up into this level, but we're not really seeing any continuation. So if it
13:27
looks like a range and it trades like a range, then it probably is going to be rangebound,
13:32
okay? Because markets generally range 70 to 80% of the time and trend 10 20 25%
13:42
of the time. So when you zoom out and you look at this chart here, even when
13:47
you go far as back as this here, you look at the large phases of rangebound
13:54
price action. This is a range. Okay, this is a whether you want to accept
13:59
that this is a range or whether the lower bound is a range, you still have a range and you have the upper bound of the range. Okay, you can see from 1516
14:07
to to 30K, we spent the best part of May 22 all the way through to October 2023.
14:14
That's almost 15 16 17 months. Then you
14:19
have a period of markup. Okay, very fast from October through to March. Okay,
14:30
the start of March. So, the end of October, early November, November, December, January, February, March, you
14:35
have this break up. We get sideways price action from March all the way through to November. Another six months
14:42
and then you get this thin leg up from late November all the way through to December. just four, five, six weeks of
14:48
price action before we found a top which is capping price. There's your range. Okay. So you can see markets are
14:55
generally rangebound for large time periods in comparison to trending
15:02
markets. So the question you've got to ask yourself is given where the market is right now again I don't have the
15:08
answer to this but is the probability from this current point in the market
15:14
are we likely to see aggressive continuation higher or are we likely to see some rangebound price action still
15:21
within here now for me the answer is very simple when I look at the market
15:26
from an auction theory perspective okay when you look at this as as a larger
15:33
higher time frame market structure. This to me is all rangebound price action.
15:40
Okay. Now, now this is subjective to the type of trader that you are. Okay. Whether you're a scalper, whether you're
15:46
a day trader, whether you're intrae or a swing trader, a positional trader. Okay?
15:52
So, so the context of time is really subjective to each and every one of you
15:59
and the time frames that you trade. Now, I consider myself a fairly versatile
16:04
trader. I don't really scalp at all, but I do intraday trade. Okay? Now, there
16:10
are periods when I intraday trade and that's when the volatility is fairly
16:16
low. The average true range is fairly low. But when I become a swing trader or a positional trader is essentially at
16:23
these key inflection points, swing fails in the market. Okay, there are they are
16:29
for me some of the best levels that I can hold onto a position or hedge at these highs in the event that we get a
16:36
rotation back down into this mid level here. Okay, that's essentially how I'm looking to play markets. So, at these
16:43
high time frame inflection points in the market, okay, these are the levels where
16:49
I'm looking for a reversion back into the mean. If I'm looking to long, I'm looking for a reversion back into the mean and so forth. They're my positional
16:56
trades. Now, at the highs, one one thing that I've done in in terms of trading is is change my approach, right? Um, the
17:04
reason why I short nowadays is not because I'm trying to make money and that's it. I'm trying to cash out. The
17:10
reason I short something like Bitcoin from a trading perspective is because the profits that I make from Bitcoin
17:15
from shorting Bitcoin actually go back into buying Bitcoin at a level that I perceive to be value. Okay? So, if I
17:22
think Bitcoin's coming into value and and I managed to and and I'm managing to ride the trade down on the short side,
17:29
I'm going to close out that trade for a profit and buy some Bitcoin with it. That's just my way of stacking Bitcoin.
17:35
And equally, from the hedge perspective, it just offsets any downside risk. Now, I've said it before in previous streams.
17:41
Exo, well, why why won't you sell your spot Bitcoin? Because every time I'm buying and selling spot bitcoin,
17:48
I'm essentially executing um a taxation clause. Whereas, just by
17:54
holding my spot bitcoin and it goes higher, then great. I don't have to really worry about having to buy buy
18:00
back into my Bitcoin. I'm I much rather send it into a cold wallet, cold storage, and just leave it there.
18:05
Because that's kind of my my approach and why, you know, people say to me, why are you shorting Bitcoin as Bitcoin at
18:12
the highs? Why are you standing in front of a steamroller? It's very simple. Because if this rejects, then I'm
18:17
locking in the gains that I've made and I'm looking to close that short and buy back either at value or even lower down
18:24
looking for much much higher prices over the next 5 to 10 years. That's just my personal approach. Okay.
18:32
So when you look at the markets here, I think for for me personally when I look
18:38
at this whole entire range, um
18:49
could we get a breakout? You absolutely have to be open to the possibility of this trading higher. The only thing that
18:55
I would not want to see if I was
19:00
net long, currently I'm delta neutral, but if I was net long, one thing I would not want to see is Bitcoin trading above
19:07
these highs, okay, for a period of time, say 115, 120 or 117,
19:14
and there's no momentum. We get a retest and it breaks down again, then I think we're in for a deeper correction. Okay,
19:20
that's something that I would not like to see. However, if in the scenario
19:26
where over the next six to eight to 10 weeks, we generally know seasonalitywise
19:32
that Q3, you know, can be very quiet. It's very rangebound price action. I
19:38
can't really recall the last time that Bitcoin broke out aggressively in Q3
19:44
printing new highs. It's it's generally been Q4 where we see that aggression coming into the market and that's from
19:50
October, November, possibly December generally speaking. So when I look at the market here and I think okay well
19:56
look I've got a clearly defined midle here. Okay, we can see where price
20:02
came into previously tested the mid trading back towards
20:08
the range highs. Okay. So, generally what I try to do is map out this as a
20:13
zonal area.
20:21
Okay. And I generally do the same again with the lower bounds of the range. This
20:27
is all I'm looking to do in terms of business wise. Now, by no means am I going to say to you guys, and I think
20:33
this is really I I'll give an example of something that isn't really objective. When you see somebody pointing out an
20:38
arrow that Bitcoin is going to come into 87, that doesn't tell me anything. Okay, what am I supposed to do with that
20:44
information? Nothing. There's nothing I can do with it. But objectively what I can say is
20:49
that look look if Bitcoin does start rejecting from here. Even if we get really close up on the lower time frames
20:56
and we see price push up into this level but it fails to take out this high. It
21:02
takes out this level here. There's there's a lot of aggressive market buy that gets absorbed and there's an unwind
21:08
of positions. Then we have an issue. Then I think we get a rotation. take out these lows and if it goes under 105s
21:15
then I think we you can't really rule out the possibility that we could see a retest of 98 potentially into this down
21:23
candle okay demand zone where we saw initiative buyers. Now what's initiative
21:28
buyers? What's auction market theory? When you think about auction market theory and again a a balanced range is
21:34
just price action. Okay, where price is trending in a range. This is a a balanced environment. you have
21:41
responsive price action which is where price trades the extremes but it gets rejected and reverse back into the mean.
21:49
Now generally what you also have is kind of a if you think of a profile okay uh
21:57
bell curve distribution shape okay with the point of control generally at the center markets uh range okay in in terms
22:06
of price price generally stays within value for 68% of the time where you get
22:11
the extremes at these left and right tails which find when you find a
22:17
rejection price reverse back into the mean. And that's essentially what's happening. If you think about a bell
22:22
curve shape with a point of control here, if you see a rejection at the range lows, it's likely you're going to
22:28
see a move back into the mid. Same with the highs. This is classic responsive price action. Okay, that's acceptance
22:36
within this balanced environment. But initiation or initiative price action is
22:42
when you see buyers stepping into the market, pushing the market higher, and you get a thin move. Okay, there's no
22:48
real pullbacks and it's a very very fast move higher until the markets find a level of balanced environment. Whether
22:56
that's consolidation, whether that's distribution, it remains to be seen. But this is your initiative buying. Okay,
23:03
that's what you want to see on a breakout. You don't really want to see price pushing up and then finding responsive price uh responsive price
23:10
attributes or conditions where price rejects and trades back into into the mean. So, when I look at this, that's
23:17
what I'm thinking. It's like, look, we're at the extremes of this high time frame range. We can't seem to find any
23:23
breakouts. I would I wouldn't rule out the possibility that we get a deeper retrace
23:28
potentially back into this level again. Okay, that's all I'm going to say. just watch out for this downside. But with
23:34
that it presents an opportunity that if we do trade into 97s, 96, 95s and we
23:41
find acceptance back inside this range. Then everything that I've just covered, you want to see this re this to to not
23:49
get not get accepted. Okay, outside of the range, you want to see price showing
23:56
a willingness to return back to what the market deems to be value. Okay, back into that
24:02
value area. All right, and it's the same on the upside. If we get a a push up that gets rejected, then I think we we
24:09
probably will see back into 105s potentially to the other side of the range. Okay, that's that's all there
24:14
really is to it if I really want to keep it simple from these higher time frames. I'm not really going to talk about the lower time frames and how I've been
24:20
intraday trading. I don't really think there's much to offer. I think the bigger trades are these key inflection
24:26
points and that's certainly where I really look to load up in terms of position sizing, swing trading. They are
24:32
the key inflection points that I like to trade in the market. Any questions?
24:52
Anybody with any questions, let me know in the chat. Is that clear so far? Okay, let's have a look at the uh fixed volume
24:58
profile to which is something that I think is a fantastic tool. When you look
25:05
at where the pro where the market was previously in balance and and this is
25:10
actually very important to pay attention to this when you are using
25:18
the fixed range volume profile tool. You don't just mark it out on on an area of
25:25
balance. Okay? You really want to be anchoring this tool from where you have a break of
25:33
balance. Okay? This is a balanced environment. Look at the what the concept that we just covered of
25:39
responsive price action at the highs and the lows. Okay? At that edges or the edges
25:46
of the range, okay, that's where you're going to see rejection. These are some of your best trading setups. Range lows,
25:53
range highs, okay, reversion back into what is considered to be value.
25:59
But where you want to really anchor the fixed volume profile tool is when you get a break above balance and acceptance
26:06
followed by an imbalance and continuation until the market finds a balanced rangebound environment again.
26:13
So if you take the fixed volume profile tool, essentially I want to be marking it from this impulse here. This was the
26:18
impulse out of the range and this is where price is currently trading.
26:31
So when we do that okay if you just recall what I said about the bell curve
26:38
here in terms of okay and 68% of the 68% of the first
26:45
standard uh deviation is deemed to be u the value area. Okay with your point of
26:53
control somewhere in here. This is where price generally spends the majority of
26:58
the time. So when you draw it sideways, that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] example there,
27:05
you can think of that as a range. And 68% of the time price is likely to find
27:13
itself trading between the first standard deviation of this. This is where there's there's an
27:18
agreeable acceptance of trading between buyers and sellers deemed to be at fair
27:24
value where at the extremities you're either going to get late longs or
27:30
aggressive shorts piling in along with forced sellers and
27:35
forced market buyers. So anybody who's shorting this here is probably going to get stopped out. They become a force
27:41
buyer. Anybody who's when you see price action like this, so for example, when you see price, here's an here's an SR
27:48
demand zone, right? Okay. When you see price, I don't know, there's some structure here, right? Price rallies higher, price comes lower, it just stops
27:55
short. Anybody who starts longing this is probably going to put their stop under here. Price rallies, it comes back
28:00
down. Now, if you've got your stop under here, what are you doing? You become a foreller. Therefore, price is dropping
28:08
faster into this level. Now whether this level holds really depends upon the fact
28:13
that are there any participants passively absorbing all this aggressive market
28:18
selling I'm not saying shorting I'm saying market selling whether that's
28:25
fresh shorts opening whether that's longs closing the only way you're going to gauge that is through potentially
28:30
looking at something like open interest looking at the delta and looking at the CVD so that's something that you need to
28:36
pay attention to because if these passive orders get pulled Well, you've got thin air. There's absolutely nothing to stop the market
28:43
going lower down. Okay? Until somebody or some aggressive well, some uh large
28:48
entities, let's say, because it's not me and you who stops the market from falling. We're just small players in the
28:54
grand scheme of things. These are your corporate commercial players who will decide that right this is value for us.
29:01
We want to step in. We will absorb this aggressive zone. this is a great opportunity for us to to fill our
29:07
inventory. Okay? And it's the same on the opposite side. It's not any different when you flip it and you're
29:14
looking for shorts at resistance. How often do you see price when price comes into resistance, you think, "Oh, this is
29:19
a good level to short. You got your stop above here gives you a shallow pullback and it just blasts through on high
29:25
volume." Well, these shorts are now forced buyers. Number one, that's
29:31
cascading price higher. Then you've got breakout traders piling in. This is why you get those fast moves. When when
29:37
price breaks out of a range, it shouldn't [ __ ] around. Okay? If it does start [ __ ] around, then you know
29:43
you've got a problem. But when it really takes off, it's a combination of shorts being forced to close out their position, short liquidations happening
29:49
in the book. The spreads get blown apart. What happens when the spreads get blown apart? Well, there's a lack of liquidity in the books. And when you
29:56
have a lack of liquidity, what happens to the market? it can go from A to B
30:02
very very quickly and that's why you have these very thin inefficiencies or what some people call all that there's a
30:08
fair value gap or a single print or an imbalance that's essentially what you're
30:13
looking at
30:19
okay on these moves here that's what price does okay it doesn't [ __ ] around
30:24
when it breaks out so if we are going to go higher then the The way it's going to happen is essentially shorts or hedges
30:31
being forced to close and break out longs piling in and we shouldn't [ __ ] around because if we do, that's my
30:37
point. We're probably going to see a reversion back into the mean. And if you understand how markets work, generally
30:43
they stay rangebound longer than than we can potentially or possibly anticipate. All right. So, I'm just trying to give
30:49
you an understanding of when we think about market context, when we think about breakout trading, when we think out think about truly what drives
30:55
markets higher and the dynamics of how markets work. By no means what have what
31:00
I've just said is exhaustive, but it should help you understand the underlying dynamics of how markets
31:06
function under the hood. It's not because, oh, my SR line is here. Look, price rejected from there.
31:12
Your line had [ __ ] all to do with it. It's the fact that some large players here decided that they want to offload
31:19
their inventory, not because you had your line here rejected, okay? Because if they pulled their passive uh sales,
31:27
price can easily trade through there. Okay? And that's why on news-driven environments or news-driven events, if
31:33
you have a shitload of support here and a [ __ ] ton of passive bids, but for
31:38
whatever reason, Trump comes out and decides to announce 200% tariffs tomorrow on China. Well, what do you
31:45
think is going to happen when it comes to this level? It's no longer going to hold. It's just going to go straight through it until the market deems that
31:51
this is now actually value in terms of what they perceive to be value. Okay?
31:57
until passive participants decide to step in and buy what they believe is oversold relative to to how they value
32:05
Bitcoin. All right.
32:13
So, back to my point. When you look at this fixed volume profile, this is that initiative drive. This is that
32:19
imbalance. This is that thin move. Okay? Because if you look out look at the volume profile here, it's relatively
32:26
thin. This is not something that you want to short when you have these initiative
32:33
moves in these imbalances until you find a level of value being accepted where
32:38
price is now finding acceptance at this rangeb environment. And when you look at this here, this is what's important to
32:45
me. If this is value here, then it where's the value area high? The value
32:50
area high is acting as a level of resistance. You can see that every time.
32:57
If you just give me one second,
33:07
if you look at this, this is slightly more clear now. Okay. When we talk about using the fixed range volume profile tool,
33:13
where is price rejecting from? Where is the value area high? See, where's the
33:19
point of control? It's down at 9695s. Okay. Where's the value area low? This
33:25
is where price has spent majority of the time.
33:32
And you can see the the responsive price action at these highs. So my concern
33:38
here is that if we do get a push back above this 109
33:43
110 level, we need to see acceptance of price above these levels to give to give
33:49
it the possibility that we will see significantly higher. But if we get a rejection or if we see price trading
33:56
above here and then back inside, I think there's a really good chance that we could trade back into 96K. And that
34:02
really lines up with this demand zone. And it also lines up very confluently with the high time frame range high,
34:10
okay, and the high time frame range low. When you look at the mid of this, this
34:16
is what I'm looking at essentially. Okay, there's our mid level. So, if we do happen to trade back into the point
34:23
of control and find acceptance back above it, I'm a buyer and I think we trade back into the range high. If we
34:28
find rejection, then I've got to be open to the possibility that we could trade back into 82s. All right, that's just
34:35
we're a long way from that just yet, but that's kind of how I view markets. Okay, from the higher time frame perspective.
34:42
Has that helped you guys understand how I use the fixed range volume profile tool? And again another way of using it
34:49
that was on the the macro time frame. If I wish to use it on the lower time
34:54
frames again how can I identify the anchor point on using a fixed volume
35:00
profile tool? Well if you look at the the what you have to think about again is how markets auction.
35:07
Did or did not the market auction lower down from this point here. And then at
35:12
which point did the market auction higher? It was this point here. So, if I'm looking to take this fixed volume
35:18
profile range in terms of recency, I want to map out the the initiative move up through to where the current price
35:25
is. And again, when you look at where that is, it's from this zone here on the 4 hour. This was where the market
35:31
auction down, the market auction back up. What do we find? We find ourselves trading in the value area. Okay? If you
35:38
look at what's been capping price in terms of support, it is the point of control. We have resistance at 109's.
35:48
I am not really willing to uh intrae trade this. I'm willing to day trade
35:53
this. But in terms of intra week, I need to see either price push above here into 109s, clean up these poor highs, which I
36:00
will show you on the market profile chart, get back inside, and I think we then oscillate back towards a value area
36:05
low because price often spends a significant amount of time gravitating
36:12
between value area high, value area low until we see acceptance. Okay, this was
36:19
again responsive price action where price trades into the value area low. We
36:24
see price coming into this extreme into this demand zone. What does price do?
36:29
Buy step in. Push the market to the value area high. Okay. Rotations between value area low and
36:36
value area high are some of the best trading setups that you can play in a range one market environment. Okay.
36:51
So overall I think if I had to guess and again this is just a very loosely held opinion right now. I think I would like
36:58
from a trading point of view when I look at this on the 4hour chart now I'm I'm
37:04
I'm just delving into the trading setup aspects we have this all right first of all we've got this daily supplies zone
37:10
that we've marked out. Okay, this is what's essentially capping price to the upside here.
37:16
But really, when I go into the 4hour chart, I want to refine a possible area
37:22
that if I see price trade into this zone, I want to be alert as to whether I'm
37:29
going to long the breakout or whether I'm going to short. But for me to find a
37:34
long scenario, I've got to see acceptance above this level with a spike in volume. And I've got to watch the
37:41
tape. If I see market orders flooding in, lifting the offers, it's time to go.
37:46
And if I see aggressive selling coming into the market, but it's been absorbed
37:52
by passive sellers and they can't push price lower down, well, guess what? Anybody who's shorting this and they
37:58
they are now offside, that's going to fuel the market even higher. That's generally how you get trend continuation and that's not something you want to
38:04
fade. So it's essentially if price pushes up into here, rejects, cleans up
38:11
these highs, that for me is a higher probability setup back into this level
38:17
here. Okay, that's it. From A to B, range high to range low. Okay, if we
38:23
consider this to be our support point, this to be our swing point, anything in
38:29
between is for low time frame rotational trading. Anything at the extremes is what we're interested in. Okay, that's
38:36
all I'm looking to do. The other point that I want to make here is
38:42
we've marked out this 4hour supply zone up at the highs. If we trade that and get a reaction,
38:47
I'll be very interested in looking to become a seller. If we find acceptance, I'm looking to become a buyer. Okay?
38:54
From a trading perspective, I'm not talking from a spot. I've already have I already have got spot. If the market
38:59
pushes higher, I will close my hedge for a very slight loss, giving the market a chance to go even higher. I profit on
39:06
the move higher. But really, what stands out for me are these highs here. Is the market likely
39:12
to drop without taking these highs or is the market likely to push up and again I think it's clear for me if we're trading
39:18
here and we can't really push up or even into this uh supply zone then I'm going
39:24
to take that on personally. Okay, that's all there is. I'm not bearish. I'm not bullish. I'm just looking to trade the
39:30
range on my trading account. Okay, as an investor, Bitcoin's going higher. Fine.
39:37
Now when we move over to the uh market profile chart,
39:43
if we just look at the structure of price, just give me one second.
40:05
Let's look at the TPOS's, the market profile. I know some of you are not familiar with with this concept, but we
40:10
it's something I'm going well well I will be covering in the mentorship, but essentially um
40:18
wrong chart. One second, guys.
40:26
There we go. Okay. So, when I look at this, let me just make sure that I've reset all my mergers and splits. Okay.
40:35
When you look at the market here, and
40:42
you can see at the all-time highs, we have these poor lows just short of 112.
40:48
Okay, we we haven't really traded that level again. And I I think we also have
40:54
this area here which we haven't really taken out the this 110.8.
41:00
We've got a set of poor lows. Now what's a set of poor lows? It's essenti sorry poor highs not lows. Poor highs and poor
41:08
lows are basically unfinished auctions. Okay, it's where the market never finish an auction. Essentially really what you
41:13
want to be seeing is a tail such as this. Okay, that completes the auction. Here's another example. Here's another
41:19
example. Okay, you have a series of single TPOS that confirm that it's a
41:25
completed auction. But here you can see we've got an unfinished auction which therefore creates a set of poor highs or
41:34
poor lows. And generally what the market does is tend to gravitate towards those level cleans up the poor highs and lows
41:40
and then goes the other way in rangebound environments. Okay, unless we are in a trending
41:46
environment in the market. Now, that's one level that I'm watching very carefully. Okay?
41:52
And if you look at where price currently is, it's this level here. Okay? That one
41:58
there, we also have another set of poor highs at 105s.
42:05
We also have a set of poor lows at 107.2. So even from a TPO perspective, if I'm
42:12
looking to intrae trade this, I know immediately exactly the levels that I'm
42:18
interested in. And that is going to be that we take out this, clean these up,
42:27
and if we can push back inside, we could trade the other side and take these out. If we get a move whereby
42:36
we trade higher from this point onwards, okay, clean up these poor highs and it
42:42
gets back inside here, okay, and there's a rejection, then if this is our
42:49
potential composite to see trend continuation either to the highs or lows, you want to see price
42:56
break out of this composite. And I'll show you what a composite is. A composite is essentially an overlapping
43:01
of value areas. Now, if you remember the example that I gave you with the bell
43:07
curve distribution example, okay, where price generally finds value, it's 68%
43:13
one standard deviation of the distribution. Okay? Now, if you have value areas which overlap, then you can
43:21
merge those profiles. Now, this is subjective. Some people say 70 to 80%, others say 50%.
43:29
I personally don't really have a guideline. I think what makes more sense to me is that when I look at price and I
43:35
see price in a range one environment, I'll just merge those profiles for as long as there's a good level of
43:43
two or three daily TPOs that overlap in value. Okay, now I'm not using this
43:49
because this was the impulse up. But if you look at this value area high and this value area low,
43:57
does this or does this not essentially form what appears to be what's capping
44:03
price?
44:12
And then when you look at because this was the impulse from 105s to 109s,
44:17
where's the value area low? It's there. So where is price contained from a market profile perspective? Where
44:24
is price trading for the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 days with this impulse up? It's
44:32
contained within this value area. So my take on this is is not the fact that
44:38
whether the value area you go from um left to right. Okay. My take is not
44:43
essentially the fact that oh look well this value area doesn't overlap this.
44:49
My slight nuance to this and it it's not essentially textbooks uh textbook. I will just end up merging these because
44:54
it's still contained with this entirety of this significant imbalance double
45:01
distribution day or treble distribution because you got you got a period of uh price acceptance here. Price moves
45:08
higher. You've got a bunch of single prints. Price spends a bit of time and then pushes higher and closes up
45:14
in this third distribution. Okay. And so I'm going to merge the profiles to create a composite. Merge this with the
45:21
previous profile.
45:26
Merge this with the previous profile and so forth.
45:32
It's very slow. As you can see in Trading View
45:42
and again
45:47
Yeah, I know you can make a weekly um profiles uh grant. I'll come to that in in the future streams. It's what I
45:54
essentially use on exo charts. And so now I've merged those profiles. And once I've merged those profiles, I
46:01
want to see where the value area low and the value area highs are for those. And they're coming in at this level here,
46:06
107.6 to 109.3.
46:12
So that's forming more or less my composite. Now, if I want to see continuation of price going higher, if
46:18
we get a breakout above, pull back and retest continuation, then
46:24
I think we're going for 112s. Okay? Or clean up these highs here. If I see price push up,
46:31
reject, come back inside this value area composite 7-day comp. Okay? Then I think
46:36
the probability is that we trade the lows and we trade even lower down possibly into these into these thin
46:43
prints over here. is if you understand what fair value gaps are and what single prints are then I think we could trade
46:48
back into that 105.9 105.8 a level. But for that to happen, I
46:55
would need to see price find acceptance outside of this balanced environment.
47:00
Okay? So we we find acceptance, okay? Not responsive price action that causes
47:06
it to trade, but initiative price action that sellers are in control. We get a fast move down into this inefficiency
47:12
here. Now, when you look at the price chart from a price action perspective,
47:19
what does that mean? If you go to to the 1 hour chart,
47:28
that 105 level is likely to be a a an a level of
47:35
inefficiency over here. Okay, somewhere in here,
47:44
which is close enough to a key level of support. All right.
47:50
Now looking at this current range, we know that we have a set of poor highs
47:56
here. We've got a set of poor highs from this level here. And this down here is a
48:01
set of poor lows. So it's just a matter of which level are you looking to trade and why and understanding the context.
48:08
All right.
48:39
If I just do reset all merge and splits and clean up all the scribbles on the chart. Again, when you look at this
48:46
profile here, again, it's it depends what you consider or what constitutes a
48:52
single print. Now, the one thing like you probably see ICT
48:58
fanboys talking about fair value gaps. It's just an inefficiency. That's all it is. But with a TPO chart, it really
49:05
helps you refine where those inefficiencies are. Okay? And it's right
49:10
here. You can see you've got three single TPOs, a very thin level of price.
49:16
Now, these are very interesting levels because they either act as support or resistance. So, if price trades into
49:22
this zone, you're essentially looking for price to give you a reaction from this level here. Okay? Acting as a level
49:31
of support. Okay? You want to see a reaction essentially when price is trading low and it comes pushes back up
49:37
into a single prince you're generally looking for a rejection or a reaction from that level. Okay. So for me that
49:43
that's a level of interest that 105.9 level as well. Okay. From an intraday or
49:48
an intrae perspective. So right now when I look at the charts this is where I'm looking to trade. If
49:54
this is all our value area and we trade the extreme of the value area high. Okay.
50:02
And we've got value area low and we get rejection. Then I want to short. But what confirms it is once we get
50:09
acceptance two 30 minute candle closes in the value area high then I think there's a really good chance that we
50:15
trade towards either side of that value area. Okay. And then we'll take it from
50:20
there. And if we find acceptance below it then I know can hold it down into 105 or 105.9 106es. Okay. And then we'll
50:27
take it from there. So that's how you can look at something like market profile and then write down your levels
50:35
on on a piece of paper or your daily trade sheet or your weekly trade sheet and your plans and then go to price
50:42
action chart and then refine those levels on the candlesticks. Okay.
50:52
All right. That's all there is really for Bitcoin. um
50:58
in this instance.
51:06
But when I do look at this, I mean the question I'm asking myself is,
51:11
do we trade lower down or do we push up higher and take out these highs or do we take out these lows? I don't have a
51:17
clear view in the market. I really don't. I've just been intraday trading and I think when I look at this, you've
51:22
got this candle high here. You've got these lows here. It's whatever gives
51:28
really. Okay.
51:39
Even when you take this auction up into value, look at where we're currently
51:44
rejecting. We're rejecting from the point of control. So, are we now likely to gravitate towards the lows? And if we
51:50
if we gravitate towards lows and five acceptance below here, then does that mean we're trading to that 105.9 level
51:57
over here confluent with this 4hour demand zone? Okay, that's
52:03
something that you want to see hold if you're looking for longs back up or if we just trade through that then I think
52:09
we're in uh in for a deeper correction into one or two. All right. So, a lot a lot to consider, a lot to,
52:16
you know, contemplate, but like I said, it's it's it's not the it's not the ideal environment
52:23
if you're looking to swing trade. This is more suited towards intraday trading. And that's all there really is to it.
52:30
All right, let's move on to Ethereum. Uh before I do, let me just scroll through the chat and
52:36
see what the questions are.
53:00
Just looking through some of the questions here.
53:07
Yeah, Dayton, I'll cover u higher time frame composites in a few weeks time.
53:20
Do you use Yeah, I use Well, I don't use default settings. I use 68%. Let's Let
53:25
me just confirm that actually. Uh because I always reset my um tools prior
53:30
to streaming, but
53:35
yeah, I generally use 68%. It doesn't really matter too much, but I just for whatever reason I prefer to use 68.
53:43
Yeah, TPO is great for intra uh in intraday targets. Grant, how's your trading coming on? Have Have you started
53:50
using TPO more often for your trading yourself?
54:03
Would I share my ideas on uh Forex? Yeah, I'm going to get round to Forex again in September. I've just taken a
54:09
break from trading forex. I never trade forex in summer markets if I'm really honest with you, but I will be looking
54:15
to trade Bitcoin E well Bitcoin, NASDAQ, gold. They're the three majors that I'd
54:22
like to trade in Q3 well September, October, November, December. Um let's
54:28
move on to Ethereum. I think when I look at ETH, very interesting chart. Um, again, one
54:36
of the levels that I wanted was this was clear absorption followed by rejection
54:41
and delta unwind all the way literally where I bought back in back into my ETH again. Okay, very very happy with that
54:47
trade. Talked about it, covered this on the timeline, covered in previous streams
54:52
that if Ethereum trades into 2100s, I'm absolutely buying because if you look at this from a price action perspective,
54:59
it's macro range high, macro range low. We've got the macro mid-range. We've
55:05
rejected from where the macro mid-range pretty much where the timeline was very
55:11
very bullish. Where did we pull back into into the range quarter? What was the range quarter? It was a previous
55:19
accumulation range. Okay, that that Ethereum had established
55:24
really really good retest of that level. Okay. And then when you look at the
55:30
volume pro uh the fixed range volume profile, if this is our balanced environment
55:36
here, in fact, let me just remove this. If this is our daily chart and we have
55:44
almost two weeks of price action here.
55:51
Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 two weeks of
55:58
price action. What's the impulse that led the market higher? And so therefore,
56:03
it's this here, right? And so therefore, what was a breakout of balance? It was this. I take my fixed range volume
56:10
profile, anchor it all the way across to where price
56:16
currently is. Okay? So, every day you have to come in and readjust this uh indicator. Where's price?
56:23
It's back in fair value. It's back into resistance. It's at the value area highs again.
56:29
Okay. So now the question is do we find acceptance above here or are we going to
56:35
find resistance here? This was the time to buy. This here was the time to sell.
56:40
Swing fail these highs. Rejection short. Stop at the highs. Trades back into the
56:46
valuary high to the inside of the demand zone. Okay. Buy this, sell this. Nothing
56:52
to do here. we're into resistance whether we push up and reject and gravitate back towards a
56:59
val value area low or whether Bitcoin trades 112s, okay, or we make another push at the highs and reject and we
57:06
remain rangebound in this entire zone. Okay, one thing that I alluded to over
57:13
the last two streams in June and in May, I I specifically stated that I don't
57:20
think people are prepared for exactly how long Ethereum can remain
57:26
rangebound within this zone. If you look at price action here from A to B,
57:33
this was early August all the way through to
57:38
November. Four months of price action where price
57:44
oscillated from range low to range high, range low, almost a range high. Okay.
57:52
And so when you mark out a fixed range volume profile here,
57:59
this was the impulse down. Okay,
58:06
look how long price spent in terms of the value area. You want to be looking for opportunities at the value area lows
58:14
or into this demand zone. Look how thin price is here at these extremes. Okay,
58:24
4 months of price action that was rangebound. So when we look at the present day price action, how much time
58:31
have we spent from this impulsive move up
58:42
two months? It's it's July.
58:47
Maybe we spend August and September in here before we get a Q4 rally in
58:53
October, November, December. So the question is if price does trade the value area low and lower down into
58:58
support, as long as this holds, I'm a buyer. And if price comes up into and rejects, I'm a seller. Okay? Until I can
59:06
trade the next range here. That's all I'm looking to do. I'm not going to bull
59:11
post into resistance. I'm not going to be bare post into support. I'm going to be aggressively buying this and I'll be
59:17
looking to be cautious at resistance in case we get rejection and the move down because these are your high time frame
59:24
inflection points in the market. That's all there is to it. And I don't care what the sentiment is.
59:30
If people are getting bullish, fine. Makes no difference to my trading decisions.
59:36
Okay? So, so all I'm saying is that don't let your emotions eb and flow.
59:42
Okay? just make very good objective decisions. Be prepared for lower prices
59:49
such that if price trades back into support over the next two months in August, then you want to be looking to
59:54
buy this as potentially something that's oversold from what is fair value unless
1:00:00
we find acceptance and break below this support zone. Okay, so this is
1:00:07
what I would perceive to be a very good buying opportunity. Okay, until we break
1:00:12
down, then I would have to write I'm now even even better. I'm happy to take a small loss. I'm going to get to buy ETH
1:00:19
at a greater discount in the view that over the next 12, 18, 24 months that Ethereum could potentially be printing a
1:00:27
macro bottom. Now, this is the worst case scenario, but again, I'm just trying to tell you the mindset as to how
1:00:33
I approach markets. If this is the adverse scenario, this is [ __ ] fantastic. as a buyer. This is
1:00:38
brilliant, right? Unless Ethereum goes to [ __ ] for whatever reason. But this down here is a fantastic buying
1:00:45
opportunity to trade back into the high time frame, mid-level again because again, this for me is all one big range.
1:00:54
Okay, a range within the bigger range when you treat
1:00:59
it from level to level. I practically practically don't care what the [ __ ]
1:01:05
people say about leveltole trading. Been doing this for nine nine and a half years. I do this as a living now. Okay.
1:01:12
And I back myself to do very well.
1:01:19
So that's all there is on on Ethereum. When I look at something like hype,
1:01:26
I struggle to really understand
1:01:32
why I would want to buy hype as a positional trade at $40
1:01:39
and say, "Look guys, I think hype's going to go to $80 in the next three months." It could do fine, but from a
1:01:47
positional perspective, I'm not sure I want to do that. I' I'd much rather
1:01:52
trade this and that's trading it to the range lows or looking for opportunities
1:01:59
to buy at the range lows. Okay? Or even filling this inefficiency to the left here. Okay? Because we had
1:02:07
look at the impulse. This was the impulse out of out of here. Okay? This expansion. So in here from where these
1:02:14
wicks are down to this level here is your ICT fanboy fair value gap. Okay.
1:02:22
And so when you look at this from a rangebound perspective, if you have this as
1:02:29
the range highs, this as the immediate range lows, and we come in and take out these lows
1:02:36
here, possibly into this level here
1:02:42
and we find acceptance, that for me is a trade back up into 36 from 28, back up,
1:02:47
back up into 36 from a spot perspective. I might even buy some as well. Okay, for a longerterm play.
1:02:56
Now, what gives me a level of concern is when I look at the trend scanner,
1:03:03
what have I taught over many many months and many years that look at the trajectory of the moving averages. Okay,
1:03:09
this is the 1225 daily EMA. You do not want to fade this because look at the
1:03:15
trajectory of the moving averages. Now, look at what's happening. We are forming a balanced environment. Okay. Buyers and
1:03:23
sellers are accepting these prices as fair value here. Now, at some point, one
1:03:31
side or the other is going to dictate where anybody who's buying up here is
1:03:37
realizing that they're going to take a loss and pick their positions. Anybody who's profited on the way up may look at
1:03:44
this and think, "Right, it's time to take profits on my trade." And therefore they're looking for lower
1:03:49
buying opportunities. And then your buy side demand disappears because now people are waiting for what they believe
1:03:55
to be fair value or perceive to be value of buying hype into a level of demand
1:04:00
wanting to see price hold these levels. Buyers need to be stepping in and you can buy at a discounted price. Okay,
1:04:13
Kenneth. Uh good question. At what time frame do you determine acceptance below or or above a level?
1:04:21
It really depends what time frame you're trading upon, what the context of your trade is. Are you intraday trading? Are
1:04:27
you scalping? Are you intrae trading? Are you swing trading? Are you positional trading?
1:04:33
So you see how ambiguous the question becomes because really you want to be asking yourself is
1:04:40
what time frame am I trading and what am I looking to achieve behind this trade setup? What's the expectancy behind this
1:04:47
trade setup? They're the questions that you want to be asking yourself.
1:04:56
Okay, just give me one second. Any
1:05:10
final questions? Because I'm going to wrap up in the next few minutes. Um, but if there's any final questions, please do let me know.
1:05:58
This to me does look like distribution if I'm honest with you, but I could be wrong. Okay, but it does feel somewhat distributive here.
1:06:05
That's my range. If I get a rejection from there back inside and look at the wicks. Okay, look at the wicks. If this
1:06:12
wicks off into here and rejects, that's that's another selling opportunity and I think we trade the mid of this macro
1:06:19
range. Mid-range, range highs, range lows. These are good swinging opportunities here. Okay.
1:06:41
All right. One final point. So, let me just have a look at the questions in the chat.
1:06:56
Yeah, the mentorship on the the Okay, so so basically I I've had a thought about
1:07:01
the mentorship. Uh and again, I appreciate so many of you have full-time jobs, you've got children, you've got
1:07:07
commitments, and you can't absorb all the information. I will ensure that the information is accessible
1:07:14
for the foreseeable future. Okay? I'm not going to pull the plug in August. it will be available for those of you who
1:07:20
are part of the mentorship. Okay. Uh after the mentorship ends, the mentorship probably ends in the first or
1:07:27
second week of August. I'm taking a break. I want to focus on my trading in in Q4. Uh and then maybe we'll probably
1:07:35
look to do something towards the end of the year again in terms of regular videos. As you know, I've never run any
1:07:41
paid groups. I'm not looking to run a paid service. If ever I do something, it's always going to be because, you
1:07:49
know, I want to give back to the community, but it's probably going to be under some charity related ref link. All
1:07:55
right? If people want it, if if if they don't, then fine, not a problem. Makes no difference to me.
1:08:04
I want to leave you. And for those of you who watch the mentorship, you already know the you already know this slide. But these are the questions you
1:08:11
want to be asking to yourself. If you can write these down before you take a trade, answer these
1:08:17
questions. What is the market trying to do? Is it succeeding or failing? Where
1:08:22
is value forming? Who's in control, buyers or sellers? Are we in a balanced or imbalanced environment? And how is
1:08:29
value migrating? Okay, whether you apply that to hype, whether
1:08:35
you apply that to Salana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, NASDAQ, really the key question
1:08:41
is what time frame are you trading upon? Okay? Because depending depending on the
1:08:46
time frame, you will all have different answers. If you're scalping, if you're day trading, if you're swing trading,
1:08:54
it's subjective to the context of time and price. Okay? and then the volume
1:09:01
aspects.
1:09:10
What does my Exo chart setup look like? I've been working on this actually quite a fair bit. Um, this is what it probably
1:09:16
looks like. It was a really, really good setup today. Um,
1:09:33
I'll probably cover it. I'll save it for another time. I'll save it for another time.
1:09:39
But this is because I'm on a smaller screen here. This is the DOM on the right hand side. So, basically, I'll just quickly explain what this is. And I
1:09:46
think this is something that I would like to touch upon over the coming weeks or months. Okay? So, I really want want
1:09:52
to focus more on educational content. Um, in terms of order flow, I've always held back. I've always talked about
1:09:58
price action. I've never really commented too much about order flow. I
1:10:03
simply because the fact that it just goes above people's head. When you look at this, you just you're just going to think, what the [ __ ] is this that I'm
1:10:08
looking at? So I generally try to just keep it native to what I believe is very
1:10:14
important which is understand your price action concepts first before you start looking at this other things of your
1:10:20
trading. Okay. Um and so something like this is is essentially what I use on a
1:10:25
day-to-day basis. But I only use this on trading an asset like Bitcoin. I don't use it for trading altcoins or futures
1:10:31
or whatever it is. Okay. So that's that's the DOM. Here you've got the um the price. Here you've got your volume
1:10:37
profile. Okay, so we talked about volume profiles. If I just increase this to 400 ticks, and you can
1:10:44
see, okay, there's a value area low, there's our value area high, there's
1:10:49
your excess on one side, there's your excess on the other side. If you look at this from a profile perspective,
1:10:55
then what shape are we making here? We are making a P-shaped profile. And if
1:11:03
price closes, okay, if this is the the profile for the end of the day and we find acceptance in here, then what does
1:11:10
that tell us? That tell us that prices the market tried to sell off. Okay,
1:11:16
anybody who was long has been stopped out, but buyers managed to push price higher and close back inside this
1:11:24
P-shaped distribution, which is generally deemed to be positive for higher prices. Okay, for as long as we
1:11:31
can start shifting value higher until we get, you know, an imbalance and then
1:11:37
we'll probably find a level of bracketed environment again. So that's something to watch out for over the coming day or
1:11:45
two is to see if we find acceptance above this 109 level. All right, that's
1:11:51
something very fairly trivial, fairly basic knowledge, but these are some of the things that I look at on the DOM.
1:11:57
Okay, depth of market. It's real time orderflow looking at uh transactional data. It's about as close as you get as
1:12:05
it's about as close as you can get to the action. Okay.
1:12:10
And then obviously I've got my
1:12:18
this is my um timebased chart. Okay. It's using a
1:12:24
level of delta using just normal candles but
1:12:30
looking at the buy to sell ratio. Okay, in within each candle here. So here you
1:12:35
can see the delta between uh buyers and sellers is 107 or well it's it's forever
1:12:43
changing $233,000 worth of contracts. Okay. And again I can change the text
1:12:49
type to bid. Okay.
1:12:55
And I can change the candle type to bid ask. So this tells me that in terms of buying at this level, $552,000
1:13:05
worth of contracts bought here and 2 million of sales came out this level
1:13:10
here. Okay. And again, these are some of the basic concepts that Magus has covered. I think C2M has covered and
1:13:17
it's something that I'll be talking about over the coming months, probably from August, September onwards. All right, I'm probably not going to cover
1:13:23
it just just yet, but this is something that you can look forward to if you want more of this type of um educational
1:13:31
content over the coming weeks. All right, guys. I think that's going to be it for today. Thank you very much for
1:13:38
tuning into the stream. And final reminder, as always, key questions that you want to be asking yourself before
1:13:43
you take a trade, when you're thinking about a trade setup and the trade structure, truly ask yourself these
1:13:49
questions. And then if you don't know how to answer these questions, then make it your task to figure out what is it
1:13:58
that I need to do to understand this, this, this, this, and this. Okay?
1:14:03
Because if you if you're unable to answer these questions, then work on it.
1:14:08
Okay? That's what I would say. All the best. Have a great week and I will certainly catch you on the next stream,
1:14:15
which I think will probably be in August. All right. God bless. Take care. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
