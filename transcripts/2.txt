all right we should be live welcome back it's trer EXO here once again with another weekly live stream just give me
0:10
a quick audio check in the chat that you can hear me okay and you can see my screen a quick confirmation would be
0:17
much appreciated
0:41
all right fantastic good stuff good stuff so as always uh special thank you to O exchange for once again partnering
0:49
with me for today's stream as always anything said in today's video is not
0:54
Financial advice it is just my view of the market and how I'm looking to trade
1:00
the market over the coming week until the next stream um before we proceed I I
1:07
let me just bring something up on the screen hopefully this works okay so let's talk about the uh
1:15
the mentorship um should be starting in a few weeks time so let's just quickly
1:21
whist through some of the updates so first things first in this in
1:26
today's video in the description I've left a link to a poll if you guys and
1:33
girls would be kind enough to fill this in it's essentially asking you what's your preferred platform for me to
1:39
deliver the content once we go live with the group is it substack which is my preferred option simply because I find
1:46
it as a very very good way of organizing content videos sharing my thoughts um it's it's
1:55
less cluttery it's easy to like I said section and subsection and uh categorize
2:01
items the SEC second option is private Twitter again I'm open to that if people prefer a closed private Twitter group
2:08
I'm happy to launch that and uh add those members who are eligible to that
2:14
or third option my least preferred is probably private telegram um like I said
2:20
most of this will be read only it's just me sharing my thoughts it's not going to be so much two-way interaction um if it
2:27
is substack there is obviously occasions where from time to time you know I may have
2:32
two interactions or if there's any questions that's fine preferably I would like to have the q&as on the live
2:39
streams when when I do the live streams alternatively same on private Twitter over private Twitter feed I know many of
2:46
you use Twitter actively uh on a daily basis so if that makes more sense then please do let me know but like I said
2:52
telegram I'm not really a telegram proponent I generally tend to stay away from it just because of all the
2:58
unnecessary noise so if you could just please at the end of the video uh the link is in the description or on the
3:05
page as you can see here just go ahead and fill that in I'd be very keen to understand um which way you guys want me
3:12
to proceed and it's just trying to create what I feel is hopefully a very good learning experience for you all
3:18
remember this is a free private group The the only um criteria is that you
3:25
sign up using the referral Link in the description of the video and as I've
3:30
stated before all proceeds and profits will be going to charity um and yeah so
3:36
basically in a nutshell it's going to be quite intense but what I want to do is
3:41
really give you a holistic overview of my journey what I've you know developed
3:47
how I've developed and what some of those processes look like I feel as though trading is is a very complex
3:54
industry it's a very complex career um and sometimes it's very difficult figuring your way out so really what to
4:01
do really what I want to is just give away as much information as as I possibly can into some of the process
4:08
that I use so what does my trading manual look like I will probably be sharing a water down version of this I
4:14
want you to go away and hopefully find some inspiration to start coming up with your own trading manual what my training
4:20
trade planning and life cycle looks like so you know weekends on a Sunday how I break the markets down what are some of
4:27
those checklists that I go through what are some of some of the trade criterias that I go through so I want to go
4:32
through that process and also the life cycle of a trade so from trade initiation planning through to execution
4:39
through to trade management and then journaling and and burning down after the trade so kind of closing down the
4:46
trade and and how I manage that and and the mental aspects of that and then we'll move on to once we've got the
4:52
trading manual and the trade planning aspects in place and the kind of the the foundations of that we can then go into
4:58
looking at trade system ization so basically what are some of the strateg that strategies that I trade um you know
5:05
other than just ranges but also looking at Trends uh maybe understanding which oscillators I use and why uh then we
5:12
look at some of the options of like price time flow execution strategy so now that we've got a trading system
5:18
we've got to understand what what price action means the time in the trade and the context environment how I use flow
5:26
and and also when it comes to the most important part is putting the trade on is your execution strategy and reasons
5:31
to get out of the trade as well okay and then obviously once we got the foundations in place continuously
5:38
logical progress you'll see me sharing trade setups from time and time again and again like I said it's as andw this
5:45
isn't a a paid group this isn't a signal service it's just something that I want to give back to the community for all
5:50
the support that I've had over the years and it's just something you know like I said to to educate is to learn
5:56
twice second part so the structure of this it like I said it will be launching
6:02
on the uh Monday the 24th in terms of structure it will be
6:08
two to three private streams a week whether that's a live stream whether that's recorded it'll probably be a
6:13
variation of the two um what I want to do go what I want to do is go back to
6:19
the classic Sunday market reviews that I used to do so basically talking about the macro talking about global markets
6:25
covering bonds indices NASDAQ Bitcoin dollar equities to give you that again
6:33
that that the overall picture of the markets how I'm view viewing the markets what some of the macro uh information
6:40
that I've absorbed and breaking it down to you guys and just sharing my shortterm views and my midterm view so
6:46
we're going to do that every Sunday for two three four weeks then we'll cover some of the the slightly more advanced
6:52
concepts probably in the final week so the basics of auction Market Theory will will will will start including how I use
6:58
orderflow footprints for trade execution strategy or or looking for those key inflection points and what some of those
7:04
strategies are and then obviously just a a very simple primer on Market profile how I use it when I use it and where to
7:11
use it which markets I apply that to uh and hopefully that should give you enough of a foundation as to
7:17
basically what I would describe as nine years of my journey and and and and try to present that as as as a compressed
7:24
digestible way for you guys and hopefully kick on in your own career and then after that I think the the last
7:31
public stream will be on Sunday the 23rd of February I will be taking a break for
7:36
maybe a month or two so I I can't really envisage myself streaming publicly and
7:42
throughout March probably not in April as well there's a few uh aspects in life
7:48
that I want to focus on as well as my own trading challenges that I've set for myself but like I said my last public
7:53
stream will be on Sunday the 23rd I will then commence with the private group on Monday the 2 4 that shall run for a
8:01
period of 4 weeks until Sunday March the 23rd so I hope that kind of gives you an
8:08
insight as to some of the content that I'll be sharing and some of the educational
8:14
paths that will be going down towards so it's going to be touch on every facet of training such as you know basically how
8:20
to create a manual through the journaling through to how I do a market review how I do a full breakdown of
8:26
charts what what are the key check boxes that I look for before I even take a trade pre-trade planning the trade
8:33
getting ready to execute the trade when I'm in the Trade Post trade when I've close out the trade what the process is
8:39
then and we'll look at some of the more psychological aspects uh how I manage my emotions the the the aspects of trading
8:47
psychology I've got a 60-page manual that I've created Myself by referencing
8:53
various uh trading books out there geared around trading psychology so hopefully I can uh share that with you
8:59
guys and basically give you a deeper understanding of the basics of trading
9:04
psychology and why for me over the years I've come to appreciate that trading isn't really about how good you are
9:10
technically it's really about your discipline and your emotions I would even argue that 10 15 20% once you
9:16
become proficient at trading or technically very good at trading why do you find that those who are very very
9:22
knowledgeable and technically gifted [ __ ] up time and time and time again
9:28
it's clearly not a technical issue the issue is the psychology the mindset the patience the discipline your biggest
9:34
Edge is yourself it's not the systems or strategies that you're trading you can give you you I I could give or somebody
9:40
else could give you some of the best trading strategies but can you execute that do you have the mindset the patience the discipline to stick to
9:47
those rules right how often have we seen yesterday as an example when Bitcoin dropped all right it wasn't a
9:53
significant drop on bitcoin you know from 99 to '92 ethereum absolutely [ __ ]
9:58
the better alts were in complete Carnage and once again we see people blowing out
10:04
I mean should people really be blowing out like I said to you it only takes one bad trade to wipe at your account and
10:10
this game is all about survival so ultimately just just some of the mindset some of my own lessons I've I've blown
10:16
accounts in the past in 2017 2018 2019 when I was learning how to trade and I
10:22
had nobody to guide me and eventually you find out that this trading is is is
10:28
certainly much more structured should disciplined approach you have to understand all the various facets of
10:33
trading especially risk management and and talking about position sizing as well and how I calculate my position
10:39
size so these are all the many many little small facets that I want to touch upon uh throughout this for throughout
10:45
these four weeks and hopefully like I said uh if it if it helps improve you
10:50
guys and great I've I've kind of achieved my objective I'm not looking to monetize this at all it's just um
10:56
something that I want to do that I've been wanting to do for quite some time and there's no better opportunity before
11:03
I but before I head off into Q2 and Q3 take a break from from socials and just
11:08
focus on on my own aspect so last stream is is on Sunday the 23rd publicly so uh
11:14
after that four weeks like I said it will be private behind closed doors but just in the comments let me ask you guys
11:20
what is your preference would it be substack would it be Twitter uh would it be telegram if if you don't mind just um
11:27
replying in the comments I'd be really Keen to just get a quick overview um to what your thoughts are in
11:34
terms of where you would like me to really host some of this
11:48
content what's the sign uh the deadline well basically the deadline I guess look
11:53
I mean this poll runs for another six days so looking at the calendar um I'll
11:58
really start rolling out the sign up process from next week so basically if you want
12:05
to sign up today using the YX registration link uh in the profile then go ahead and do so um but I'll cover
12:12
that in more detail on the next stream which is probably going to be on I might just be doing another stream on Saturday
12:18
or Sunday uh if not before so that still gives you a two weeks to sign up before
12:24
we go live on the 24th ideally I'd like to have everybody enrolled by Sunday Sunday the 23rd because it's going to be
12:30
a ball L with all the admin making sure that you've uh met the requirements to join the group I've then going add you
12:36
manually into the groups or into the group and and make sure that everybody is on board as well if you're late not a
12:42
problem you know I'm I'm not strict um if you late by a couple of days just just ping me a message or we'll figure
12:49
it out but like I said from next week I will have a Google form so as you complete the registration form please do
12:55
fill in the Google form what I will essentially need is an email address and user ID with the uh exchange um that you
13:03
signed up for deposited and traded so the the two Partnerships are okay exchange and Prim xbt so like I said
13:10
I'll have further information next week and we'll we'll certainly start the onboarding process from Monday the 10th
13:15
all right um let me just have a quick read of the
13:21
chat before we kick off the stream today
13:31
no I'm I'm not going to do Discord it's just it's just a pain in the ODS to manage Discord and like I said I'm
13:36
trying to keep this um more intuitive via the streams
13:41
and the live streams and the recorded sessions I'm not really looking to um have a two-way conversation
13:50
because it's quite time consuming it can be very very distracting and like I said that there are paid groups out there
13:55
that allow you to have two-way interaction unfortunately I just don't have the time to do that and that's why I would never consider running a paid
14:03
group in that respect myself [Music] um if it isn't monetized how is it
14:10
private well it's basically in partnership with the exchanges it's with OK exchange and PRX BT if I'm being
14:16
completely transparent you guys uh sign up with the with the exchange referral link again I'm not looking to profit
14:23
from the referral links all money will be donated to charity at the end um and
14:28
also what I'd like to actually is part of that is is to do some giveaways so some funded accounts and prize giveaways
14:33
and money give um that's also P account giveaways and and giving away some money as well just to giving back to you guys
14:40
as as appreciation and thank you for your time now Discord isn't an option like I said um you know so just yeah
14:47
like I said we'll see where we are fill in the poll please uh do fill in the poll it's very very important um because
14:53
I would love to know what your guys thoughts are okay
15:00
what about the people who can't sign via Oak exchange so like I said when I launched the Google forms next week if
15:07
there are technical issues uh there is an option there will be options on there to to leave a comment and we'll try to
15:13
get those resolved okay but I will need uh an email address for correspondence um if you already have an
15:20
account um yeah you'll have to figure something out there I mean whether that means I I'll speak to The yok Exchange
15:27
team and Prime teams whether it's easy to switch the referrals across or
15:34
not you've blown your account on o exchange well I'm not too sure what to
15:40
say there that's fine if if you can sign up
15:45
trading spot uh on o exchange that's fine it doesn't have to be Futures i' I've spoken to the team I've explained
15:51
that not everybody has access to Future so if you want to continue with the sign up process um and sign up just for the
15:58
spot Market that's good enough you know you're not in forced to to um sign up
16:05
via uh sign up for futures you can't fill the poll because VPN you yeah I've
16:10
restricted VPN uh users from voting just to stop people trying to spam the votes
16:16
um it generally tracks VI your IP address so when you can switch VPN you can obviously spam the poll so just
16:22
switch your VPN off for a moment and just just hit the U hit the poll and switch your VPN back on again it's it's
16:28
just one second it's not going to track your IP address I don't have access to those details all I have access is just
16:33
to the results of the uh of the poll
16:45
okay if okay X is not allowed in my country how can I join the group like I said we'll cover that on the next stream
16:51
okay it's just today I just want to focus primarily on on uh getting uh an
16:57
idea of as to you guys want me to host this like I said my preference is substack but when it comes to questions
17:04
around signing up or not being able to sign up we'll we'll have a Google form up so you guys can can uh potentially
17:10
resolve some of those issues all right let's crack on then with with the with the mark review I don't want to go into too much depth and details today I think
17:18
um given I mean where do you guys want me to start essentially there's so much that I could talk about such as
17:24
liquidations but I think that's been well documented we've had the move to the range lows I think this is going to
17:29
be a very short stream in all honesty um looking at the market well I say short stream but it always ends up being an
17:35
hour long but um looking at the market I think ultimately we've we've still got
17:41
the two key levels for me is essentially let's start off on the uh
17:50
monthly let's start off on the monthly chart okay on the high time frame here we go so essentially you
17:58
using the high time frame range now I'm going to ask you guys a question and again I'd like you to reply
18:05
in the comments how many of you believe the top is in for this quarter and that we're
18:12
likely to see lower prices in Q2 Q3 um how many of you believe that we
18:18
are likely to go up to the level of 115
18:23
120 in the next several weeks by the end of q1 that's one question question I I
18:29
would like to
18:43
understand so when I talk about a top I'm not talking about the top on bitcoin I'm just talking about contextually over
18:50
the next several weeks do you believe we have one more pushup um or do we continue just ripping higher to 140 150
18:57
you know how many of you think think that there's there's a probable chance that we are close to a a um interim top
19:05
before we get a corrective move down and potentially we could continue higher over the next year or
19:17
so yeah interesting it's just I was just trying to gauge sentiment see what the sentiment is in the chat more than
19:23
anything it's um in in my honest opinion I've I've really shifted the way I I
19:28
think about markets um the old XO probably would have been more predictive
19:35
more vocal about the top is in nowadays I honestly couldn't give a flying [ __ ] I
19:40
don't care if people are calling top like I said there's no good what good is it calling a top if you're not going to
19:47
act upon that information and secondly when people do call a top what are their suggestion what's the actionable event
19:53
if they can't provide an actional event actional actionable event other than just stating the fact that oh the Top's
19:59
in well what does that mean you know for me at the end of the day as a Trader I
20:04
don't really think about oh the top could be in um when I think about a possible risk scenario I'm thinking of
20:12
downside risk and if there is downside risk then what does that mean for my positions in altcoins what does that
20:18
mean for my positions if I'm holding Bitcoin or ethereum okay that's essentially what I look for I don't
20:23
really cons care too much about is the top in or not I'm asking myself I which
20:29
point do I need to be aware of the downside risk and for me in all honesty
20:35
when you look at the chart we we'll we'll go back to the monthly here when you look at the high time frame charts
20:41
you can see price is just about holding that 75 level at 93k
20:47
okay round about 93 93.5 that is a key pivotal Sr level we have not had a
20:55
monthly close below that level just yet then when you look at the
21:01
weekly again something that I alluded to last week and on the timeline uh today
21:08
that we haven't had a weekly close below 93k and every time price comes into this
21:15
Zone you can see from the wigs buyers have stepped into the market now the caveat to this is that
21:23
obviously very simply put that in order for us to see higher prices it goes
21:29
without saying that ideally we want to see this level of 88 90k hold okay so
21:36
again I don't mind if price trades back into this level one more time but I do
21:42
need to see a reaction from this level such that price closes back above that
21:48
key level of 93 to open the possibility that we could be heading back to the highs and taking out 110s into 115
21:57
potentially 120 is okay maybe that might be a scenario which plays out but like I
22:04
said it's not me predicting what the market is
22:10
going to do it's a scenario that could be on the cards right if price trades
22:16
into that 88 90k level gets back above again you want to see strength to give
22:22
you conviction in the possibility and probability that buyers are stepping
22:27
into this Market market and the macro conditions are conducive to price potentially rallying higher into at
22:34
least taking out these highs and if we can get above there then great we'll talk about the next logical level which
22:39
is at 115 120 level which I think is going to be a real sticking point okay
22:45
so I think for now as as as you look at the market you you have to be fairly
22:50
honest um we've had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
22:57
13 weeks of price action within the range and that there's still nothing
23:03
that I can gauge considerably in terms of a direction now I know comparison I know
23:10
comparisons have been made to what we had in summer right and I think the the distinguishing difference that you have
23:15
to think about is there's a reason why I was leaning more
23:22
bullish uh and we saw many you know accounts talk about the fact that Bitcoin is making lower lows lower highs
23:28
and this is bearish and we're likely to see continuation lower down the thesis that I had is the fact that look the
23:35
fact that we've had Bitcoin trade into these into this high in March we never
23:40
once took out the high lower high lower high lower high lower high lower lows it
23:46
wasn't a trend it was a rotational move lower down each time but
23:53
within the confines confinements of a range okay and because we had these
23:59
untaps highs I really fancy the probability that eventually when Bitcoin does trade back towards the highs we
24:05
take out these highs and continuation higher what's different about this instance is that well we had the high
24:13
back in December we did trade above the level whereas here we never had that okay this was the high in March 2024 we
24:22
never attempted to take that out before we rolled over now historically when you look at what Bitcoin does okay and this
24:28
is where I'm just trying to give you food for thought in terms of could the top be in I'm not calling for the top
24:35
and it doesn't matter whether I call it or not all I need to really care about
24:41
is is the risk to the downside should the market break down and you can see Bitcoin has this tendency to to take out
24:47
the highs pull back go again take out the highs and before it finally rolls over okay same happened in in October
24:55
November we got the highs on bitcoin cleared out all this this Clos back under one last attempt and then we
25:01
finally rolled over okay so that's why I I in terms of context is the top in that
25:07
there's there's a decent chance it could be in right but it's still fairly too early I guess we won't really know uh I
25:14
don't have a crystal ball I can't sa definitively where the top is in but as far as I'm concerned when I'm looking at
25:19
the market look we're still holding this range here we're still holding these lows so every time price is going to come into this level I've longed and so
25:27
far it's worked very very very well for the trade setups that I've shared the plans that I've discussed I've never
25:33
once talked about shorting this Market below this midrange the only time I've talked about shorting the market was
25:40
here as a hedge against my spot or if those of you who wish to trade per and
25:45
explain the way you want to do that and how to execute it is that you want to see a swing fill of the level and for
25:50
price to revert back to the mid if it's below the mid then we target the lows all right so
25:56
ultimately all I'm saying is I don't really have a clear Direction I wouldn't want to call the top I think there is
26:05
certainly a reasonable argument for their potentially being a top but we
26:10
don't have enough evidence to conclude that the top is in okay and generally
26:15
like I explained with xrp during the week when I when I shorted xrp I didn't say xrp of the top is in
26:23
for me it was a very good trading setup I see exhaustion at in the $3 range and
26:28
if that's the Top If I happen to show the
26:33
top then that's just a result of the fact that I managed to position into the
26:40
trades recogniz recognizing exhaustion and implicitly as a result it happens to
26:45
be at the top so I'm I'm not trying to time the top or catch the top I think you have to give yourself a chance of
26:50
being in the trade first and just respecting what price is doing so if this is the high and you caught this and
26:56
you're still in the short then great you give you you've given yourself a chance of nailing the top and if it doesn't
27:02
well guess what you if you don't take profit at some point and price trades back up then you just have to accept
27:07
that okay U if you're going to round trip this all the way you know you're going to round trip your short and watch
27:12
price come all the way back up then that's on you but ultimately how I've positioned for this is that my spot
27:18
position Still Remains hedged and I'm just trading on a perose account okay so I I really don't want to delve too much
27:25
about the whole argument and debate about top being in or not I just think look ultimately it's irrelevant whether
27:31
the top is in or not you just have to manage your risk and and be prepar that such that if price does break down below
27:39
we we start getting acceptance Below 93k on a weekly basis then that is a course
27:45
of concern because any undd rejections is probably going to lead to continuation lower down into this next
27:51
level of 72 75k okay that's kind of what I think would be the next logical level
27:56
but without further Ado this is the key level that is holding our support it
28:02
continues to remain our support any questions yeah I'm still look like I
28:08
said uh Marcus a question Marcus is asking me are you still holding your 53k sport yes I am but I'm hedged at 110
28:15
well 109 is to be precised and we talked about the the reasoning the thought process and why I was looking to hedge
28:23
out my spot positioning here okay so for now I'm delta neutral uh I've locked in the game gains from 53k without having
28:29
to sell my spot and the reason I've done that it's not often that I hedge trades Okay the reason I've done that is
28:36
because I'm cognition that look this could potentially be the top I don't know if it is but ultimately it gives me
28:42
the flexibility that all right if the top is in and price Rejects and breaks down that's fine I can cut my spot
28:47
position and ride the short down and look to profit on the market I haven't made any money on the shore in this
28:54
region right but what I have done is locked in the gains all the way up okay now if I was to cut
29:01
my spot position should we get a breakdown this is where I can start profiting from the short into that 70 71
29:09
level or maybe it's just down to 85s I don't know okay going to take it from one zone to the next But
29:16
ultimately let's just assume that I am you know I I'm hedged and let's just assume that I personally want to see
29:22
Bitcoin trade or hold this Zone here and push back up into the highs the when I
29:28
see Bitcoin pushing back up here I'll remove my hedge because I then think the probability is that we could get one
29:34
more Drive higher and who knows how high that could be it could be 115s it could be 120 it could be 125 it could be 130 I
29:42
want to capitalize on that as a continuation trade should my short uh
29:49
hedge be closed out I can ride momentum higher okay that's what I would be thinking so I hope that explains uh the
29:56
question that you asked me with regard regards to um am I still holding my 53k
30:01
spot yes I am but regardless of price going up and down it's not making a difference on my p&l at this moment in
30:07
time I've locked in the gains so the spot is more of a it just gives me more flexibility as opposed to [ __ ] around
30:15
with my spot position buying selling buying selling selling buying maybe I I start formal buying at the highs and I P
30:21
my position again it just affords me that level of um insurance I should say or comfortability that I can just let
30:28
the market play out and start trading on my pers account looking for those rotational plays because price is in a
30:34
Range
30:41
okay uh yeah I mean there's a question here about o exchange yes they are uh I
30:48
think they've got the ma license so they will allow members from the EAA so yeah
30:53
you should be you should be able to sign up um what are my thoughts on Marcus rashford
31:00
joining Aston Villa he's gone to a better club that are above United so fair play to him he might get Champions
31:06
League football next year he's he's not going to get that man united is he um
31:11
okay so in terms of the high time frame context let's just quickly again go over the stock I think
31:18
this is really interesting the fact that the daily is at the low so again I'm not overly bearish just yet you know I'm
31:25
just looking at price objectively and and thinking about about trade ideas I took the trade yesterday I've closed the
31:30
majority of my trade I took 50% at 101.8 and I took the remainder off at 100 today when price started breaking
31:37
down so I'm fully out the trade now okay I managed to get a long in from uh 92.8 just under 93s took that to 10 101s uh
31:45
for 50% closer remainder at 100 um and that's all the risk to that so in terms
31:51
of the daily stock uh this is hovering at the lows if you look at the weekly now I talked about the fact that look
31:59
if you recall in the previous stream or the last two streams I mentioned that if Bitcoin is
32:04
going to go higher then with the stock RSI at this mid level you will likely to see
32:12
strength in the market with a confluential factor on the stock if this crosses back up then the
32:18
possibility would be we we would have rallied significantly higher the alternate scenario that I said is that
32:24
look okay worst case scenario and I remember this from a week or two ago that look if the RSI the stock RSI
32:32
starts drifting lower down and price can remain holding this support level I
32:39
think that's positive and I I will be looking to attack the market from a long perspective okay rolling it
32:47
forward you can see that now
32:55
um you can see that the stock on the weekly has not quite cycled to the lows but
33:03
we're not too far away so the the the next question is is how much time is
33:09
this likely to rotate honestly at the lows and hopefully can Bitcoin hold the
33:15
lows at 90 88 to 90k all right that's what I'm looking for building a base and again I talked about this on today's
33:22
timeline that I would like to see Bitcoin I don't mind Bitcoin trading back towards that 88 90k level as long
33:30
as it can hold the level and build a base I'm going to be looking for Longs because it gives me a clear invalidation
33:36
that if we start seeing acceptance on the weekly time frame below 93k then I've got to start start
33:43
thinking about all right what is the probability of now price breaking down and trading into that 80k level next or
33:50
85 or 80s okay so we'll cover that in terms of setups on today's stream but
33:55
that's kind of the thought process with the stock is that clear any
34:03
questions so we're we're not too far away now I I would ascertain or assume that probably
34:10
another week week or two before we start seeing a bottoming process and maybe
34:16
that takes us into mid-February for a bottom or a local bottom of Bitcoin as long as this can hold if it doesn't then
34:22
I think that's that's that's a major shift in structure I really do
34:31
I'm not going to be talking on alts today just primarily focus on bitcoin um again when you look at the weekly RSI
34:36
it's fine it's above 50 that's not too bad daily when you look at the daily it it is hovering below 50 now generally
34:44
okay when I see the daily RSI hovering below 50 and remaining below there that
34:51
to me is evident that there is somewhat level of weakness in the market
34:57
okay and I would only be comfortable in terms of really picking up the momentum and
35:04
being aggressive such that if Bitcoin can trade into these lows and the RSI can just hold off here
35:12
push back above the 50 level show me strength then I'll feel more feel more comfortable about the possibility that
35:18
we could go back towards the range highs okay and then hopefully and some to 115
35:24
120 so that's what I'm looking for but however if the RSI is continuing to show weakness and
35:32
price is breaking down it's a weak reaction we get a limp BCE and it starts breaking down into another lower low
35:38
then I think there's a real possibility that we could break down into that 85k level okay so the key for me is is is
35:45
not so much this demand Zone anymore I would say the key for me on a daily time frame is
35:53
perhaps more this demand Zone here
35:58
could it be the case where when you look at Price action in terms of in terms of what I'd like to
36:05
see in terms of a reaction if there is a deep pullback is does price come in and
36:12
take out this low here and this low here and should it do that what you want to
36:19
really identify in the next 10 days is that all right we don't mind price coming into this
36:25
level but are there enough passive bids resting in the book such that when
36:31
shorts aggressively start opening into this level or there's an aggressive an
36:37
aggressive level of spot selling being absorbed along with shorts piling in at
36:42
this level and they're unable to push price lower down and price reclaims back above that level that is a trigger that
36:49
I will take because watching the flow watching the tape watching the footprints I want to see shorts really
36:56
piling in but unable to push price lower bids are absorbing all that
37:03
selling and when when these get caught offside they're going to compute their short position and you'll you'll start
37:09
to see momentum Longs Pile in and that's what gives you these fast moves okay fast moves up it's essentially what we
37:15
had here when I talked about the fact that I'm looking for price to take out
37:20
uh the lows here that's what we got we had a very very fast move back up to the highs okay so something similar and is
37:26
that going to give us what could potentially be the up thrust after distribution before we get a break down
37:31
again okay remains to be seen but just something to keep in the back of your mind however if there is aggressive spot
37:39
selling and shorts opening and you and we're likely to see it again liquidation
37:44
of Longs the question is is this level going to hold and are we going to reject on the inside and
37:50
continue lower down then you've got to be open to that scenario as well okay so I don't know what's going to happen is
37:55
is the honest truth but all I can talk about about is the levels that I'm focusing on and how I'm thinking about
38:00
price what I'm thinking about in terms of real time uh trading so many of you
38:05
ask me hey EXO what time frame do you do do you execute your trade is it the 1 hour or is it the 4 Hour and again I
38:13
don't look at 1 hour candle closes or 4H hour candle closes I will pay attention to something like a weekly pinb bar
38:20
close right because that often is a sign of a reversal or potential reversal you
38:26
need to see continuation on the next candle but what I generally refer to in terms of execution is non-time based
38:33
okay so I'm not looking at the 5 minute chart or the 4 minute chart or the one minute chart thinking all right how's
38:38
the candle closed I'm looking at the flow of data and reacting so the key
38:44
phrase for that if you want to look this up and we'll talk about this on the um on the private sessions is non-time
38:51
based execution okay I can't get the text tool up so I'm not even going to try to type up yeah forget that
38:58
but non-time based not time based but non-time based okay that's what I look for if you're not sure what that is
39:04
Google what is non-time based trade execution you'll figure it
39:10
out moving on to a slightly more refined chart I think what we have is and what I
39:18
think we could continue seeing is the high of Monday which was also very close
39:24
to the previous Monday High
39:36
sorry that should be Monday's high and we've got Monday's low so I
39:42
think above all I I do believe that this is the range that we're going to be contained within for the next several
39:48
days or so so you've got Monday's high you've
39:53
got Monday's low and when you look at the the monthly open again wide I take profit at that 10 1.8 one or two level
40:01
well surprise surprise there's your monthly open okay at that same point just where Monday's highs were that's
40:07
essentially where the monthly open was and that's the reason why I I aggressively took profit after the uh
40:13
the bounce that we had yesterday okay fairly good bounce into the highs into monthly open essentially where we
40:19
rejected from that was good enough for me all right so now we've got Monday's high and Monday's low um the key levels
40:26
that I'm thinking about here is look contextually we are finding resistance
40:33
at the mid level so we've got December's low we've got December's high this is
40:38
predominantly where price has been trading we've traded above the mid sharp
40:44
aggressive move we found resistance and acceptance where remember the key range
40:50
that I talked about in the previous week's stream was this Zone here this is a previous trading range we Now find
40:57
ourselves back within there and I
41:03
think probablistic probabilistically I think we're probably
41:09
going to be contained within this range um and what I would be looking to find is are we likely just to find some sort
41:15
of Base building here are we likely to run December lows take out this low take
41:23
out this low so again when you're looking for a possible demand Zone which hold up it's that daily block somewhere
41:29
here okay essentially you want to see price if it is going to break down lower trade into here very
41:36
aggressively quickly reclaim back above this swing low here that's going to be be my trigger to get in stop at whatever
41:42
low this is that's my trigger and I think I would be looking for price to trade back into the mid okay into that
41:48
mid round about that 100K level and I think if it can do that I would then give it every possibility that right we
41:54
could go back to the highs for a third Drive okay we've got one drive here two drives here are we going to get a third
42:00
drive somewhere up here okay that's kind of what I keep leaning towards um is it really the case where we're just going
42:06
to break down and [ __ ] the bed over the next few weeks I'm not sure okay but I am aware of that downside
42:12
risk and and that's all in all honesty that's that's the best I can do I I don't have a crystal ball but I can tell
42:18
you exactly the levels I'm looking to trade and why so the two scenarios here are essentially such that if we can take
42:26
out this low here and this low here extreme scenario where I think once again you're going to see aggressive
42:32
bearish sentiment on the timeline panic and fear but price essentially comes and trades into this demand Zone here on the
42:40
daily like I said what you're looking for is price to reclaim back above there
42:45
stop at the lows you want to see acceptance back above the December level back above Mondays low or the previous
42:52
Monday low if it's next week into that mid level that's a fairly good trade okay now the question is EXO what if
42:58
that doesn't happen uh what if we don't get the sweep of the laws what are you going to do then like I said it's not
43:03
just one scenario it depends on what price is doing right so ultimately for
43:09
me um when I look at this daily level here this daily block the key thing for me is
43:17
that we've had this low here are we likely to back fill most of this
43:24
week and again if we do there's two ways that I will trade this using Monday's
43:30
low or Monday's range and this is where I I talk about
43:36
trade execution and trade strategy so please I think this is really important to listen to is that what happens
43:43
if the cases where we don't take out this low and we don't even take out this low yet you're waiting for that scenario
43:49
that I talked about oh uh sweep out these laws reclaim back above yeah sure that's probably the best setup that
43:55
you're going to get but some times what you find in these instances is that
44:00
price will drift lower and just stop short of this low here okay and push
44:06
your away in this instance the strategy for me is very very simple what I would then do if I can
44:13
just clean up the charts if I was to drop down into the 4our time frame just to um illustrate
44:20
the the example that I'm talking about is something like this so when I
44:26
talk about trading the extremities of a range where whereby I
44:33
have the Range High the mid-range and the range lows okay when I
44:41
talk about doing business I always talk about doing in the in the 25th percentile or the lower bound of the
44:47
range so anything into here and it pushes away looking for that shift in micro micro structure a higher low so
44:54
you get the lows you get a higher high okay there's a l low there's a higher low pull back sorry there's a higher
45:00
high in context to this swing higher low that's going to be the trigger so this to act as a block to
45:06
hold trigger to go long all right because we didn't get that deviation or That Swing fi or that sweep where price
45:14
takes out the previous candle closes back above it you get the stop at the low back in the range continuation
45:21
higher so you won't always get the scenario sometimes price will stop short
45:26
consolid and that's where I'm not thinking about a swing field strategy or an SFP or trap
45:34
Traders this is where the subtlety of execution comes into play what I'm thinking about on the lower time frames
45:40
is all right can price come down it stops short of this swing low here it
45:45
starts pushing away okay pulls back gives me a higher low into this block here that's going to
45:52
be the execution for me to get long all right so it's kind of like where you got Swing Swing
45:58
there's your high there's your lower low lower high lower low push back up do I say that right low lower low
46:06
lower high lower low higher low into the block or a pullback into a higher low
46:13
shift context time to go okay and what you ideally want to see is some level of
46:19
Wicks on The Daily being printed okay that's what you want to try and
46:25
identify it's actually very very similar to to what would have happened occurred here I didn't take this long but again
46:30
if you look at this look how price just stops short of this level here right
46:36
just UPS short now I'm going to break this example
46:43
down in this instance you had a very clean swing fail on on the left hand side of this
46:50
swing Point these are my favorite because it gives you such a clear invalidation you've taken the liquidity
46:55
or what you assume is going to be liquidity Traders get trapped price reverts rips the other way but what do
47:00
you do in this scenario ignore what happened after this right up to this point I want you to just focus on this
47:07
part here how can you execute the trade here
47:13
have a think about that and think about what I've just
47:19
said when you go down onto the 5 minute chart and again what did I talk about
47:25
when price comes so close to this here and this is all you get okay you
47:33
wanted to see a sweep but you never got it but what did I just talk about in terms of Market structure look at the
47:39
the the current structure of Swing points there's your lower low there's a lower high in reference to this what
47:46
does price do prints the higher high gives you the pullback this now acts as
47:51
the the demand Zone that you want to see hold your stop is at the low your execution is in here this is where you
47:58
want to take take the trade setup all right so a long position scaling in stop at the lows You could argue that you
48:05
could take a a partial position fill here parti partial position fill here and you're looking for price to trade
48:11
back into that mid Zone that's how I would set up for it again look at that subtlety in shifting Market
48:17
structure now what if you're what if I was wrong okay in this instance what if I took the long here and price starts
48:24
breaking down that's fine because at that point point if price is breaking down then I know in my mind that okay
48:31
look I don't know what's going to happen next but I'm going to bet on the possibility and probability that we run
48:36
this low here and if we run this low here what other lows are we likely to
48:42
run if you look left could it also be that we run this here and this here
48:48
swing fi this that gives me a better entry or or a better probability that now I can take a second attempt because
48:55
this level never helped it it started rolling over I cut the trade very quickly I now anticipate that all right
49:01
we could run these lows here next run those lows get back inside now I'm trading the swing fail we've taken out
49:08
this low taken out this low get back in the trade long again so again keeping the loss is relatively small you're not
49:14
just going to Long the market and think right I'm not going to have a stop here
49:19
I'm just going to I think this is low price goes up and before you know it just assume it didn't go up it rips down
49:25
you've just lost a big drunk of your account because your risk management absolutely dog [ __ ] poor so really it's it's about execution and that's why I
49:32
talk about the the three strike rues sometimes you have to appreciate that trade execution is very very difficult
49:39
because you can't quite figure or feel just looking at Price action which level
49:44
is going to give you that reaction that you need to see and that's where orderflow Footprints kind of gives you
49:50
some form of an advantage as to what's actually happening under the hood what's the Delta what's the positioning and
49:57
then you want to use that as Confluence just as you would perhaps use an oscillator of your choice that's
50:03
actionable that's where the reading the tape reading the orderflow comes in and it's difficult to preach that unless I'm
50:09
recording the screens in real time and then go going over in hindsight this is why I executed this is what I looked at
50:15
did and that's why I hit the long okay but in this instance it's not a definitive um crystal ball that's going
50:21
to make you into a pro Trader for the next 10 years of your career it's just a tool of confluence
50:27
that you use in Confluence and price action so I hope that makes sense so when it comes to these situations that I
50:32
don't know for certain if this is going to be the level to long okay um what I
50:38
am doing is giving myself a chance of that all right I think there's a probable chance that we might push away
50:44
but I'm open to the possibility that I I don't mind taking a small loss or getting stopped out risking 1% knowing
50:51
that we could run this low or this low and then if those runs uh lows get run and I see shorts piling in and there's a
50:58
strong Wick and it find exceptions back above then I think there's more possibility and probability of the trade
51:04
working out my favor okay strike two or strike three it's a very difficult skill
51:09
to perfect is trade execution you're going to find yourself cutting chopping cutting chopping and trying to get a
51:14
feel for it but eventually the more you do it the more you become accustomed to trading there are other ways this isn't
51:21
the only way it's just my preferred way you can potentially scale in and hopefully that you get onethird of your bids filled that's also fine Others May
51:28
just point on the fact that yep these are the lows here I'm going to leave my uh bids here it doesn't get filled price
51:34
goes away tough Sho that's just the nature of the market okay does that make
51:44
sense so the socities of trade execution and price action I'm understanding when to use
51:52
which in which environment and what the context is for trade execution
51:57
so the key is if for example just to summarize we don't get a run of these
52:02
lows what you want to see is that shifting structure if this is the trend down you want to see price break micro
52:09
structure into a high low this is the block that you want to see it needs to hold push away scale scale scale go for
52:17
it okay otherwise cut because now we don't if you're going to break down further or if we going to swing fail
52:23
these it's a game of probabilities swing fail get back inside side long go for the highs go for the mid then go for the
52:29
highs all right subtle absolute [ __ ] subtleties okay that's what trading is
52:37
about not some TOS spot telling you oh yeah guys yeah this is support we really
52:43
need to see Bitcoin hold this level uh if it doesn't then that's the real concern for Bitcoin balls and bears will
52:48
be in control doesn't tell me anything about execution all I know is that look here's here's a demand Zone obviously
52:54
this needs to hold but but what am I doing as a Trader you're not telling me what I'm doing all you're giving me is
53:00
is dog [ __ ] analysis which you can teach to a 16-year-old identify demand Zone and say all right guys here's a demand
53:06
Zone um it needs to hold the support thank you very much here's $1,000 thank you for subscribing to my paid group big
53:12
deal doesn't tell you about the about about how to execute the trade or what to think for what to look for
53:18
right and and again it's I'm I'm not having a dig at anybody but I'm just telling you from my own experience of like I want to give back to to to those
53:26
who aspiring to trade what I wish I had to learn and I'm not the only one there's some great Traders out there
53:31
that stream there's BTC Charlie there's SC there's Trader Magus there's a bunch of guys who talk about how to look for
53:37
Price action how to look for uh shifts in structure what to identify
53:44
okay so I hope that makes sense just more educational I'm not saying that
53:50
this is going to be the law but I'm just trying to give you guys tips uh and how I how I look to execute price in which
53:56
scenario do I execute a swing fail in which scenario do I aggressively attack a higher low but it never took out the
54:03
lows you've got to have a couple of ways to execute you've got to have some strategies strategies alone just for
54:17
execution now having said that wouldn't wouldn't it be a shame If this just all goes to [ __ ] and um Bitcoin breaks down
54:24
Underside reject oh my get that then it is unfortunate but that's just the
54:30
market I'm I'm positioned for that case okay by hedging
54:35
out and and that's all I can do I hope it doesn't happen but the reality is it
54:41
could happen and that's not my decision I have to respect what the market does
54:47
the market doesn't give a [ __ ] about what I think the market doesn't give a [ __ ] about my trading opinions the
54:53
market doesn't care about my trades it doesn't know who I am okay so you have to be respectful about what the market
54:59
will do next it doesn't owe you anything
55:06
essentially my good feeling honestly um here's the thing my good feeling
55:14
is I don't know I honestly don't know I I don't know I think I think there's Arguments for a possible top being
55:21
in um but that's just that's not actionable if I think the top is in it's not actionable for me in fact I've
55:28
already actioned upon that by talking about hedging out at the highs two weeks ago okay so that is my action I don't
55:35
know if the top is in but I've positioned for that should it break down I'm going to cut my spot below here if I have to and if it means re buying my
55:42
spot if this is all just a deviation and we get back inside then I'll just Reby my spot if I'm if if if I don't get to
55:48
Reby my spot fine I'll just profit on the short on this leg down here I don't know it's a game of
55:54
probabilities
56:01
right let's move on uh let's move on
56:07
to I've actually missed quite a quite some important aspects here so looking at the uh Trend scanner
56:15
on The Daily I'm just going to draw an arbitrary line here let's just assume
56:21
this is I don't know where's December's low again oh it's over here isn't
56:28
it this one here okay that's December's low again let's just start top down I
56:34
mean when you look at the the weekly 12 25 25 down at 85
56:47
okay where I think the probability of a top increases is like I said when you
56:53
start getting compression of the Bands okay when you start seeing the momentum
56:58
dissipate and price is doing this and this is rolling over then that
57:05
increases the probability but for now I have to
57:11
respect the trend I want to flow in the direction of the market okay one thing
57:17
that I've really focused on and this is why I I generally believe that my my trade selection my trading performance
57:23
over the last 16 18 months has been fantastic because I've decided to go
57:28
with the flow of the market I'm not trying to counter trade Trends okay this was different down here whilst we're
57:34
rangeb for for for the best part of June 2022 all the way through to um October
57:41
okay since since o since October 2023
57:46
I've RAR talked about aggressively shorting the market I've only ever talked about hedging at the highs that's
57:52
all I've ever talked about I've never talked about explicitly shorten the market like I did in 2020 2022 okay so
58:00
for now I'm respecting the trend I'm giving the trend an opportunity to keep proven to me that the market or the
58:06
context to flow in is on the way up so I'm looking for those buying opportunities to hit the long and again
58:12
there's going to be a time when I will be wrong on the long and that's just acceptable I have to manage my risk
58:19
that's all I can do and take the loss CU there will be a point where I have to shift context and I don't
58:25
necessarily want to be shorting at the lows if I'm shorting it's always going to be at the extremes of the range at
58:30
the highs okay because the the invalidation level is so clear that if
58:35
price pushes up I I I take the loss but I don't want to be shorting this into support I'd much rather say all right
58:41
fine if price breaks down I cut my losses I miss out on a short big deal
58:47
there's always another trade elsewhere the first primarily primary action is
58:53
survival cook get the [ __ ] out of the market and protect your p&l don't sh don't eat
58:58
[ __ ] in raw down essentially so that's on the weekly um
59:04
when I look at the 3day again I I like this how this is shaping up again if you
59:09
look at the stock on the RSI I do like how this is shaping up you know we are
59:15
seeing look I've said before that when price is
59:20
bearish on the RSI is rolling over like this look at the move that you get down
59:25
but the fact that we've we've been oscillating lower and we still haven't broken down and we've been here for
59:31
almost the highs were back in December we're still within this range
59:37
okay there's nothing to give me guarantees that we're going to break lower down or we're going to break
59:42
higher up so I'm just going to keep trading the range until if this curls around and this is support then I think
59:49
there's a good chance that you know we we we could essentially pop higher as well
1:00:00
okay are we going to get something like
1:00:06
this 117 120 and then you get the swing fil all
1:00:12
the deviation then we get the breakdown okay that wouldn't surprise me xrp did something similar to this okay
1:00:18
very similar pattern just just not this pattern not this structure here I'll I'll do it again for you guys where you
1:00:24
get price rallying up and what it does it it just absolutely shits the bed
1:00:29
takes out these lows and then gets back inside the range xrp classic example the
1:00:35
trade that I took exactly what it did okay it ran the highs it got everybody
1:00:41
fairly bullish and excited about the market and the one thing it did took out these lows here that was a beautiful
1:00:48
shot that I took and I might get to do it again higher
1:00:54
up so don't be surpised surpris if we see something like this and then and then you get the aggressive sell off and
1:01:00
then a a reaction back up again it wouldn't surprise me keep it in the back of your mind if it does okay just as you
1:01:09
think this is bearish here you think oh [ __ ] you know this is breaking
1:01:15
down if it breaks here again one more time it's over but essentially what it does this push up hover then it slams
1:01:23
down and goes back up
1:01:35
do I ever trade the news no I don't trade the news I'm not a news Trader uh I feel as that you have to be at your desk quite often to trade the news I'm
1:01:42
just a discretionary retail price action Trader who's um learning every year
1:01:49
that's all I am
1:01:57
how do you balance a volatility with having a family quite simple really trading the
1:02:03
extremes uh if you if you if you've known how I trade um when it comes to Rangers rangers for me are a walk in the
1:02:09
park now I know exactly what I'm looking for and what I need to see to execute the trade that's why I think I've got a
1:02:15
very phenomenal hit rate win rate when it comes to rotational rangeb environments and for me it's always been
1:02:22
at the extremes okay it's always always at the extremes where I've nailed the trades okay that 25th percentile of the
1:02:29
range low 25th percentile of the range highs everything else I generally ignore
1:02:36
unless I'm willing to take a high conviction low time frame trade but you can see one opportunity two three four
1:02:44
five six opportunities in 12 weeks I've probably taken four trades on bitcoin this year that's all I've done
1:02:52
so already fourth of uh February this year alone I've taken one two three
1:03:00
trades on bitcoin a fourth on a short uh earlier today that was intraday short on my challenge
1:03:06
account I've closed that out for a couple of thousand gain that was
1:03:11
it so four trades on bitcoin this year this was the very first trade that
1:03:18
I took hedged at the highest took profit I wouldn't classify this as a trade it's
1:03:23
just a hedge against my spot
1:03:30
there are people who are saying we are not going to trade below 90k soon because the largest Li liquidation event
1:03:35
didn't even didn't even make us go into 90k what are your thoughts I couldn't give a flying [ __ ] what people think all
1:03:41
I care about is what the chart tells me what other people say or think doesn't really matter again what people say or
1:03:48
think are they giving you something actionable or not okay that's all that matters yeah just because Bitcoin didn't
1:03:55
go below 90k when we had a big liquidation event what does that mean can you say for C can they say for
1:04:01
certain that Bitcoin isn't isn't going to go below 90k or is it just you know
1:04:07
purely speculative or uh we think Bitcoin is going to hold up
1:04:27
yeah we'll have a look at trade light um let me just bring back the EXO indicator uh Trend scanner
1:04:33
again so the daily um this is a slight concern here so look um
1:04:41
again we're hovering below the the 1225 daily
1:04:47
so it's really choppy right now but like I said this is the range that we are
1:04:54
that I hope we still oscillating whilst the moving averages rotate back up again
1:05:00
and then we get the move up that's what I'd like to
1:05:20
see um let me just log into trading light
1:05:37
flying
1:05:44
F there we go
1:05:56
all right so trading light um for those of you asking again let's just map this
1:06:02
out properly now so let me just Mark out the chart I'm going to just wrap up on this because in
1:06:08
terms of actionable Trades that I'm looking at and and how I think about this now moving forward um I've already
1:06:14
caught the trade from 93s just under 93 to 101.8 I've closed
1:06:20
out the remain out 100 I'm looking for another long opportunity um I took an intro short
1:06:26
close that out so in terms of actual
1:06:31
Confluence or with trading lights the high is December's High the
1:06:36
low is December's low okay the the mid of this entire range on
1:06:44
the December's range is this here right so we've got our mid defined
1:06:56
so we've mapped out the range the next part is all right we've got this demand Zone
1:07:02
over here which starts at 90.5 and it goes down to
1:07:08
86.5 okay now if you've learned anything from what I've shared previously I'll
1:07:13
probably use the wick of this here and in terms of trade execution I would draw
1:07:19
a low time frame range on that candle on that demand Zone okay so again another
1:07:25
way I do do uh trade execution is draw a range on a high time frame demand Zone
1:07:31
and there's your mid level okay such that should price again come into this
1:07:36
low reclaim back above and take out this that's an execution to get into the trade if it comes here takes out that
1:07:44
low gets back above that mid there's my low stop at the lows here get back above
1:07:49
here let's go okay that's how I use a a range on a demand Zone there so just
1:07:55
another subtlety that I'm sharing on stream today um now in terms of trading
1:08:06
lights if you look at this this is on the Futures book you have a fairly decent amount of
1:08:16
um stacked B uh stacked bids here from
1:08:21
93 all the way down to the 85 that whole entire demands on there it's pretty
1:08:26
stacked now if I group this by a
1:08:31
thousand doesn't really tell me much and again this is on the Futures account but I can gauge that should price trade into
1:08:40
92 93 and like I said if it respects this
1:08:45
structure over this Wing low here where we just push in but we stop short you look for that shifting Market structure
1:08:52
there's a breaking uh micro structure there's your demand Zone it can even bring it
1:08:57
across that's the level sorry not not quite as much as that but that's the level what you want to see you want to
1:09:03
hit the long here invalidation at the low trading it up okay into this set of
1:09:09
asks from 9293 into 105s if we go into the Bitcoin uh spot
1:09:19
book again grouping by a th000 we can see that
1:09:25
the highest nodes here are coming in at 90 there's 357 91 and there's 431 92 so
1:09:35
again the key to using heat Maps is that one like I said you want to see price
1:09:42
okay and we'll cover this on the streams and the private streams price trading into this
1:09:47
Zone these passive bids absorbing all that aggressive selling okay what you
1:09:54
don't want to see is is these bids getting pulled and price [ __ ] all the way through
1:10:01
it if there's aggressive selling Market selling into these
1:10:07
passive bids and these shorts get trapped price starts pushing away what
1:10:13
would you do if you shorted out the lows and price is pushing away you're going to close your short out aren you and then eventually you're going to get
1:10:19
momentum trade is piling back in then we've got the liquidity to the upside all this here okay that's what I'm
1:10:25
thinking about so we're still in a bracketed environment between 110 and 90
1:10:30
that's the the entirety of the range that was still contained within all right that's what I'm thinking
1:10:38
about does that make sense so it's not evidently clear like I said it's a bit
1:10:43
dicey I can't get a clear read where price is going to come next and I could be wrong I could be completely wrong
1:10:50
about price trading lower down for whatever reason we we might trade above there's Monday's low there's Monday's
1:10:57
high we might just stop at Monday's mid reclaim back above Monday's high does that mean we go back to to alltime highs
1:11:03
there's that possibility that you have to think about as well not a trade that I I would personally take but it's there
1:11:10
for those of you who wish to do so your invalidation is essentially M
1:11:16
Monday's mid-range if you think this is low in here then Monday's mid-range is is is your invalidation point it's just
1:11:23
like another range pivotal point get a rally lose it opens the probability we trade the lows into Monday's lows okay
1:11:29
at that 92 93k level and like to showed you on the on the on the heat Maps there there's a stack of bids resting there
1:11:36
you want to see them absorve any aggressive
1:11:42
selling all right xrp I would love absolutely love
1:11:51
to short this one more time I think this is pretty much [ __ ] if I'm honest with you if you look at the um the 12 and the
1:12:01
25 the squeezing okay what I would love to see is price
1:12:07
trade back into this range here please give me anything in here rejection again
1:12:14
I will short this back down into this trading it down towards this at that point not shorting it in one trade but
1:12:22
short short into a level bounces short again into that level inverse the chart
1:12:29
that's what I would
1:12:36
do give me that higher low another higher low keep going break
1:12:43
out slam into their $140 at some point um what makes me
1:12:50
believe that we could see price pushing higher in this instance is the fact that
1:12:56
I feel as of the daily stock is pretty much done at this point the question
1:13:04
is is this Capp in price okay or are we going to get a drift down
1:13:11
and then one more pushup lower high into that Supply Zone again and
1:13:16
price rolls over we'll have to remain we'll have to wait and see
1:13:22
essentially but I I do feel as though we are very close to a top on xrp if you
1:13:28
look at the uh the bit stamp chart and BTC USD sorry xrp
1:13:39
USD I mean like I said time and time again when you see rejection of Wicks as
1:13:46
a key level that is a sign of weakness so I would love to see price I don't
1:13:52
know how but I I would love to see price push up into that $3 level one more time it may not happen we might just
1:14:00
get 290s rejection I'll be looking to short this back down into into here that 160
1:14:09
level so that's kind of my hedge against the market going to [ __ ] is if the
1:14:15
Market's going to go to [ __ ] xrp is going to go to [ __ ] even more that's how I would view it I've already had one
1:14:20
fantastic trade into these lows I would love to get a second can trade on this into 160 so this is just
1:14:28
another way that look if I don't want to short Bitcoin but I want to get some short exposure just in case some Market goes to [ __ ] then xrp I think sets up
1:14:36
nicely for that um for the optionality of being long Bitcoin short
1:14:42
xrp if we see rejection
1:14:58
salana um I personally I mean don't quote me on this I really think the high
1:15:04
am salana is in I I I said that don't be surprised uh I think I tweeted that one
1:15:10
more move up price was down here and I said one more move up and that's all we get on salana so I really do think
1:15:16
there's a there's a good chance the high might be in here I'm sorry to say it but it really could be in my only hope him
1:15:23
and what I'd love to trade is something similar to this structure here so if you look at salana right what it generally
1:15:31
does
1:15:37
is [ __ ] sake
1:15:44
um price R is from I don't know one 1 uh 150 to 260 aggress s guess where to 180
1:15:53
right that's same level that we had in 2021 where everybody was
1:15:59
bullish I openly flipped bearish and salana at the highs and I said I think the tops in and I started shorting
1:16:05
salana and what I was looking for was one more pushup into this level here to
1:16:11
really start getting aggressive okay with the breaking structure break the structure that's it it's game
1:16:19
over into that structure start breaking down that's pretty much cooked for me
1:16:29
okay there we go clean clean price action but what's interesting or
1:16:34
fascinating about this is if I just clean the chart or let me just um if I
1:16:39
do that yeah there we go um it's that 180 level again okay when price is at
1:16:45
260 it fell back into that 280 180 level sorry now if you run it
1:16:52
forward to where we are today where did price bounce off the other day
1:16:59
that same level that we had from when
1:17:06
2021 it bounced spiked up and then it rolled over that 180 level is massive
1:17:13
the way I look at it so what I'm thinking in this instance
1:17:21
is are we likely to see
1:17:29
something similar to this
1:17:34
where yeah this this is kind of the fractal that I was looking at well we get something similar to
1:17:45
this okay
1:17:54
are we going to get one more pushup into a lower high and then it
1:18:00
rolls over into a lower low there's a lot of Supply up at 300
1:18:06
from 260 to 300 there's a [ __ ] ton of Supply if I recall correctly recall um if you look
1:18:14
at salana USD T um on the Futures pair
1:18:29
there's a lot of overhead Supply but I think there's even I think it was on the spot pair that we
1:18:35
covered where it was really stacked
1:18:49
up yeah it was indeed and if you look at this and this is one of the reasons why
1:18:54
I sold my salon I averaged my average exit I tweeted about it as well on the 19th I
1:19:01
believe the top one Sal was on the 19th yeah 275 is where I exited the minute I saw the asks flood in I was like no [ __ ]
1:19:09
that I'm getting out the market there's no way we're going to break through that and there there's a lot of um there's a
1:19:16
lot of a lot of Stack cells there there really is so the question I'm asking myself
1:19:22
is it's difficult for me to to get bullish when I say bullish I'm referring
1:19:28
to should I buy salani and hold it for the next 12 months I can't get bullish behind that
1:19:34
idea but i' never said I'm bearish what I am looking for is can I get a
1:19:40
long into this level and we get a
1:19:45
rejection I'll happily short this back down if I miss the long and it comes up here and I get a rejection I'll take on
1:19:51
the short it's not oh xo's being bearish the market is telling me that if we
1:19:58
reject from this level and there's a [ __ ] T ofas up here and we can't seem to break through that and all all those
1:20:05
asks absorb aggressive Market buying what do you think is going to happen to these top buyers here they're going to
1:20:11
puke just like they did on xrp buy at the top you pay the price you get [ __ ] okay so if there is a rally and I hope
1:20:18
there is that's what I'd essentially be looking for essentially
1:20:25
um and if it goes higher fine I'm happy to be wrong it's just an opinion I think there's a good chance the top could be
1:20:32
in or other the the the the near-term top I should say could
1:20:38
be NS salana I don't know where we're going to go lower down if we are going to go lower down but that's just my
1:20:43
opinion um again if you look at the EXO indicators here on the trend scanner on The
1:20:49
Daily we've got to get above 2 226 227 if you look at the weekly
1:20:55
o that's that's starting to compress right if you look at the compression of the Bands you look at the
1:21:01
dissipation of the of the momentum and here's where I think it's definitely going to be Troublesome is
1:21:09
that if the bands start compressing and salana rallies one more time and then gets under that that that's it I think
1:21:15
that's a shift in context and then we get the uh the trend down possibly wherever okay that's what I'd be
1:21:22
thinking so from a a price action from a range perspective um I think this is the
1:21:28
range to focus on on salana you've got these Highs at 260 you've got this uh
1:21:33
definitive um lows here at 77 and
1:21:39
somewhere in there you probably going to get a very clean mid-level give or take
1:21:44
give or take
1:21:51
okay that's the range to play on salana so again when I look at the asks in the
1:21:58
uh order book and if they don't get pulled and price trades into those and they they absorb any aggressive buying
1:22:04
and and and the market car seem to push higher we've had one rejection from here we've had another one from here which
1:22:10
sold off we've had two long Wicks okay any push-ups into here for a lower
1:22:17
high I think there's a possibility we get a lower low and you've also got the break in the trend line so
1:22:25
not the best trend line but you kind of get the gist that if there is inherent weakness in the
1:22:32
market and this is this isn't just salana but across the board if there is inherent weakness in the market
1:22:39
then you've got to ask yourself what next okay do you then cash out and wait
1:22:45
for a good buying opportunity in the future remains to be seen okay I hope
1:22:51
I'm wrong I hope it goes higher but uh I'm only going to trade what I see and on what the market reacts to so you know
1:22:57
I'm not calling the top I'm just saying if there is enough evidence that we see a rally and exhaustion then I will be
1:23:04
looking to short I'm not going to hesitate shorting that all right uh so I think I think
1:23:09
we're going to wrap it up there ethereum I mean what can I say what a pile of
1:23:15
[ __ ] it really is but it's traded into what I would hope was going to hold
1:23:22
and again just an example of wrong I really thought ethereum would have held this level but the market had other
1:23:28
ideas and there was huge liquidations and here we are on a monthly time frame who would have guessed who would have
1:23:34
known that ethereum two years later well two and a half years later is going to be on its ass down here so it's not a bad level um
1:23:43
I hope ethereum can react at least give a bounce back up to 0 45s if it can then
1:23:48
great Al alss could potentially rally into February and March but we'll have
1:23:53
to wait and see see uh I think the one thing that I would look out for which it's Wednesday today uh Tuesday today is
1:24:04
that this is where it gets interesting for me so this is where the higher time frame comes
1:24:14
in my question to you guys
1:24:23
is this candle here what is this what is the name of this
1:24:31
candle we traded and this is on the weekly chart we traded into this demand Zone here right and we closed this as a
1:24:40
weekly what's the name of this candle here is that or is that not a weekly pin
1:24:46
bar potential
1:24:52
reversal [ __ ] the SFP I'm talking about the candle it's not an SFP either because
1:24:59
this was a significant low we've already taken these out and we haven't closed back above it so it's not an SFP it's a
1:25:06
pinball right um to an extent so rolling it forward to where we are
1:25:13
today something that I would look out for is can we see a weekly close that
1:25:19
closes like this very similar to what we had into I into a high time frame weekly
1:25:26
demand Zone because this was the weekly block which kicked start the up move pull back and rally
1:25:34
higher so just something to watch out for so I will cover ethereum on the next
1:25:39
stream I just want to see how this plays out and if we get a move reversing back up to that 0 4 potentially 04 five level
1:25:48
over here okay so what is that range that range that I'm looking at is this here Range High range
1:25:55
low clean chart range high range low I
1:26:01
would say there's a very good chance now that hopefully this was some form of
1:26:08
capitulation low orne BTC and
1:26:13
that we see a reversal over the
1:26:19
coming weeks very very high
1:26:24
relative volume selling note okay very very high it's not often you see
1:26:30
something like this but that is that was fairly
1:26:35
extreme okay a few uh requests for total uh
1:26:42
we'll have a look at I mean we'll start off on total what can I say
1:26:48
um still above the previous alltime high it's still holding in there so that's a good sign
1:26:55
um it's a different story if we get back below it and if we get back below it then Bitcoin is going to go below 90k
1:27:00
it's as simple as that really if this holds and we back test and and push higher towards the highs then great but
1:27:08
again nothing I can gauge from this other than uh what I alluded to that
1:27:13
I've I've started a new challenge account I think we're in a rotational environment I'm looking to play the
1:27:18
rotations if that's back and forth and that's then that's what I'm looking to play the rotations in the Market we're
1:27:24
not in a trending environment anymore guys okay we are in that rotational environment if you look at total two
1:27:30
total total two that's kind of what I'm leaning towards um total to I mean again if you
1:27:38
just look at the EXO Trend scanner it's hanging in there
1:27:43
but this is why I've got some concerns around altcoins uh I think altcoins will
1:27:48
always give you opportunity but this is really becoming a concern that that if
1:27:55
if the band start compressing price breaks above and then back down I think that is probably going
1:28:02
to be Troublesome for many many altcoins
1:28:08
okay and it's probably no different on total three not great not great you can see
1:28:15
when price starts slamming into the bands okay it can stay lower for many re
1:28:24
weeks again trajectory to the upside aggressive selling into the bands holds
1:28:29
above it consolidates you could you probably probably call this the phase of redistribution and then you get the
1:28:34
breakdown so are we now shifting into a phase of redistribution on altcoins I don't know I don't know the answer to
1:28:41
that and I think a lot really depends upon ethereum but time is ticking because generally by the end of q1
1:28:47
markets have generally gone to [ __ ] into Q2 and Q3 and in Q3 you get those good
1:28:53
buying opportunities again so I am just remaining balanced I don't
1:28:59
have a bias I'm aware of the downside risks uh I will trade the shorts if they set up and equally I will trade the
1:29:06
Longs if they set up it's a very disjointed Market Bitcoin is shown great strength ethereum has gone to [ __ ] xrp
1:29:14
is still hovering at the highs ethereum is down at the lows I can't make sense of the market if you guys can then great
1:29:20
but I can't so for me it's a question of just Trading each market for what it's
1:29:26
worth G out the days where everything moved in lock step and tandem the correlation in crypto used be tight we
1:29:33
are in an in an environment that is very very decorrelated to bitcoin that that much we know for certain Bitcoin dropped
1:29:40
from 97 um the other day from 99s 97s down to 92 ethereum went from 3,000 all the way
1:29:49
to 2000 so go figure go figure
1:29:58
uh ethereum man I don't know what to say it's it's if we get a back fill of the wick
1:30:07
again into that 25th
1:30:14
percentile break of the trend line then I will probably look to swing
1:30:20
long for now I suspect that we will just get a very much
1:30:28
rotational type of environment on ethereum I can't really say much more
1:30:33
than that you just have to wait and see what price gives you essentially but if you look at what happens here when we we
1:30:40
we we um fell off fell down from a similar level if you look at ethereum
1:30:46
back in July 20124 it was at 3,00 3,400 level okay isn't that essentially
1:30:54
what was capping price in this instance and again we got the aggressive move down aggressive move down we get
1:31:02
the Shar bounce up so in terms of the composite or the value area that I'm looking at in terms of a bracketed
1:31:09
environment I should say is this region here on ethereum it wouldn't surprise
1:31:15
me if this is the zone that we saw trading over the next few weeks until we
1:31:21
get a resolution either side of
1:31:27
this potential bracketed environment okay that's what I'm thinking now the
1:31:33
plus side on ethereum is
1:31:40
that the daily is at the lows the weekly is almost at the lows the
1:31:48
monthly can't really engage much from this so again is it a case of
1:31:55
where over the coming weeks we are likely to
1:32:04
trade this range
1:32:09
here okay if it's at the range lows if it
1:32:15
comes into this level here I'll take on the long okay into the
1:32:21
range quarter back down until we'll get a breakout momentum back to the range highs we'll have to wait and see long
1:32:29
long way off that just yet this this this there significant price action that I need to see to get to get some sort of
1:32:35
trade setup going right now I don't have anything clear onne your
1:32:40
room uh what did I yeah I I did mean that I think uh I was bullish on you so if you remember on the previous streams
1:32:47
this is what I had I'll just reflect so for me uh I
1:32:53
said that look as long as ethereum can hold these lows here is this another inverse Head and Shoulder the minute the
1:33:00
minute we got below 28 I had to get out I literally genuinely got out the pr uh got out and that was it that's all I
1:33:07
could do I had to get out the market the minute we broke through that level into 27s I sold all my theory at a loss
1:33:15
because my average cost cost bases were around about 3100 so this was my average cost basis this is where I had to get
1:33:22
out and I had to take the loss okay and that's just life but at the end of the day when I look back in hindsight I
1:33:28
was very pleased with how I managed the trade and sometimes when we look back it's like thank [ __ ] for that I got out
1:33:35
the position because what followed soon after it's pretty horrendous okay and
1:33:42
there was no guarantee that price was going to bounce up and it's come back into that 2800 where I guess anybody who's bought
1:33:50
is just looking to get the [ __ ] out of the market at this point so this is a key level of resistance so the next
1:33:57
question I have is again Monday's high sorry Monday's low
1:34:05
and Monday's high is this the range on ethereum over
1:34:12
the coming weeks and we have a fairly definitive midlevel that's Monday's range and again
1:34:19
if there is a back fill of this Wick
1:34:25
potentially I'm not sure if we're going to get down there but potentially into perhaps the range
1:34:31
quarter of 22s and back above the mid I may look to
1:34:37
take that trade back on again
1:34:43
okay well I said this was going to be a short stream but surprise surprise it
1:34:50
isn't but I hope you found that helpful today okay
1:35:05
